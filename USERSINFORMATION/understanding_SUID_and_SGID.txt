SUID= set user ID 
SGID = Set Group ID 
stick bit = 


                                  THE SUID 

The suid works by interacting with commands . for example when you run cat command on a file that requires sudo command 
you will recieve permission denied but when the SUID is changed , this will allow any user whether privieged or not to 
have access to files and can view and alternate anythuing on the linux system 

NOTE: When an executable fiel with suid is executed the resulting permissions will have the owner of the command and 
not the permmison of the user who executed the command 


                                   to run suid do this 
you do this on command executable files like cat exectuble file , to do this the following should be implemented
                                     in file persmission there are usually 4 digits which is 0000
                                     the first 0 represents the SUID but its very optional thats why it seems its 3 numbers but its four
 

 TO SET SUID BIT ON THE FILE 

  FOR EXAMPLE YOU WANT TO DO THIS ON THE CAT FILE 
              4 reresents the suid 
   sudo chmod 4755 /usr/bin/cat


   and when the ls -l command is run . please note these things 
   1. there is an addition of s which looks like this rws = s here represents the suid   if the s is CAPITAL S then it means there is no executable permissions applied to the file 

   2. the file becomes red in color 


                                    you can alsoset the suid using symbolic mode


                                     sudo chmod ( this can represent either u , g , o) + s (and the path of the file)


NOTE: it is very important to remove the suid from each file because of security bridges , PASSWD has suid set 

                   to find all commands that havr suid 

            find usr/bin/ -perm 4000
            note: this search all files which have suiid permissions


            nOTE: IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE SUID SHOULD not be sent by the system or download applicatiosn that have suid se

                                                       SGID 
in SGID , the file or permissiosn having this id will run with the same privileges as the root 

NOTE: SGID is usally set on directories

                              for example you want to set sgid for a direcotyr called saturday

        you run the command  = chmod 2770 /saturday/ or chmod g+s (andthename of the folder)

        THE SGID also represents s like the suid 


                                                    STICKY BIT 

The sticky bit is applied to a directory , it simply states that the user can only delete files for which he owns 
or for which he has explicit  write permissions granted, even if the user has write access 

it can be used for directories like /tmp 
The sticky bit is the last special permission. 

                                              RUNNING THE STICKY BIT  COMMAND 
To run the sticky bit on a directory,  

  to set sticky bit, prepend 1 to the exisiting permissions which is chmod 1 (and the rest commands) = chmod 1111 (folderpath)

  or you can use they symbolic chmod o+t (and the directory)


if you run ls -l you will see the last permissions for others have a t which replaces the x permission 

if it it small t  it means there is an exectuble permission while if it is capital T there is no executable permission 

NOTE: IF A USER CREATES A DIRECTORY , AND THERE ARE FILES IN THE DIRECTORY which has a different permissions
the user can still delete files because of the rights given to the directory 

generally the sticky bit is used to prevent non group or privilege users permissions to deleting files in a system
