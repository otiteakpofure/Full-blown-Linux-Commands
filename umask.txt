by default when files are created in linux they have default persmissions , the umask command helps to modify these default permissions 


 by default it is 0666 for file and 0777 for directories  , 


 The umask values are subtracted from the default values stated above and the resulting values will be what is shown when the ls command is executed

                              RUNNING THE UMASK COMMAND 
To see the umask values JUST RUN umask without any arguments 

so to get the umask values of files and directories which are created do the following command

                               for files = 0666 - the displayed umask value after it was executed 
                               for directories = 0777 - the displayed umask value after it was executed

                             SETTING UMASK FOR FILE 

To set the umask values for new created file determine which umask you desire which includes subtracting the default values for file and directories which are created to the one you desire 
                                           0666 - umask you wannt (for example using umask 0002)

                                           0666 -0002 = value 
                        after obtaining these values , then run the command 

                        umask  value obtained from the above subtraction 
after running these command all files and directorie will have the umasks values created 

NOTE: The umask values will only take effect from the time in which the command was executed all existing files and directories will not have the umasks values



                                            PERMANENTLY MAKING UMASK VALUES 
To place a umask value permanent , open the .bashrc  = the bashrc is a file which contains all the configiuration regarding the bash shell 

and write the umask values in the bashrc
