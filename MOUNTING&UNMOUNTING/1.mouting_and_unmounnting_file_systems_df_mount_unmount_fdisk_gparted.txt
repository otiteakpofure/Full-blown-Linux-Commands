                               Mounting and unmounting file systems in linux 

Mounting and unmounting file systems allowed external devices to be connected to certain directories as dependent on the curren user 
linux structure is heighreical 

to see the root directory run ls / 

if you want to acess anohter fie system that is on another partition disk , you need to mount it or logically attach it to an existing directory and that directory is called mount point 

                                mouting

to mount or attach  a file system in the dirtrectory tree use the mount command . 
NOTE: if you run it it without a directory tree it will display all file systems, attached 



                         TO DISPLAY ONLY CERTAIN FILE SYSTEM 

 In displaying certain file system , the command can be for example you want to display ext4 which is linux filetyppe in major linux distubitions 

 so to view the ext 4  run the following comand , NOTE: ThIS COMMAND CAN be used to check other file types as well

                              mount -l -t (filetype)

                              mount -l -t ext4 or 32 partitions called vfat 

NOTE: AN OUTPUT REALED TO THE FILE WILL BE SHOWN 

NOTE: if you mount a device its properties will be saved on the media directory 

                       MOUNTING A NEW FILE SYSTEM TO A GIVEN LOCATION OR MOUNT POINT 

For example , you want to access the usb disk 

PLEASE NOTE : if you want to access the usb disk in virtual box you have to instll the extension pack 

in ubuntu , if you mount a usb disk it will be saved on the media/usernameof the user logged /and create anotjer dirctory directory 

IN linux a storage device  or external storage device is automatically mounted or known as a char device , in /dev direcorty and 
and because of the file type which is vfat the mount point will be found in /dev/sdb 

                                   TO LOCATE THE EXTRNAL DEVICE OR USB STICK

Run ls -l /dev/sdb  and this will show you information of th external drisk 

                                    TO GET THE NAME OF THE EXTERNAL DEVICE 

Run fdisk -l under the directory 

                                         but to find the exact name of the device 

run the dmessage command   and this will print the exact name of the device 


                             MOUTING THE DEVICE FILE TO A directory
After running the above command and discovering the name of the device , then you can mount the external device file to a different directory 

first create the directory wherre ypu want 

then run      mount thenameoftheexternaldevicefile  pathtothecreateddirctory  for this example the name of the device is /dev/sdb 


so run ,    mount /dev/sdb  and pathtothefiledirectory



NOTE: YOU CAN ALSO MOUTH THE EXTERNAL DEVICE TO VARIOUS DIRECTORIES and the mount command also detect the file system type 

but however some file system may not be detected by file system  i mean vfat or ext4


                                               SPECIFYING THE FILETYPE SO THE SYSEM CAN DETECT THE EXTERNAL FILE DEVICE

Sometimes , the filetype is not detected by the external device and as such to determine such filetypes so the external device will be detcted , the following command needs to be run 


                                         mount -t (typeofthefile in this example is vfat) /dev/sdd pathtothecreateddirctory/files



                               UNMOUNTING A AN EXTERNAL FILE DEVICE

When you want to unmount an external file device , run the unmount command and only the file to the created directory 

                               unmount (pathtothecreateddirctory) 



NOTE: YOU CAN ONLY UNMOUNTN PARTITIONS IF THEY ARE NOT USED 

OR 

YOU CAN TRY LAZY UNMOUNT AND THIS CAN UNMOUNT A BUSY FILE SYSTEM  
                                  
                               unmount -L (pathtothecreateddirctory) 


                               SEPCIFYING OTHER ADDITIONAL OPTIONS COMMAND S FOR MOUNTING 
            MOUNT -O  (PLACETHE OTHER OPTIONS COMMAND S FOR MOUNTING)  THEPATHTOTHEFILE

                      options such as ro = readonly can be used 

    NOTE: IF YOU HAD MADE A MISTAKE MOUTING AS RO , YOU CAN REWRITE THE EXSITNG MOUNTING BY CHANGINT THE THE RO TO RW = READ WRITE 




                                              MOUTING AN ISO FILE

To mount and isofile , start by creating the file you want to be able to interact with the iso file 

 sudo mount (pathtotheisofile)  (pathtothecreateddirctorytohousetheisofile) -o loop

UTILITY TO MANAGE DISK AND PARTITION:  
 FDISK 

 NOTE: but be careful with this command because it is very destructive
