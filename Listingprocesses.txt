        LIST OF PROCESS
information about a running process: ps 
  showing the tree of process: pstree 
  top: which shows alll the process information including PIDUSERS , PR, NI , VIRT , RES


                      PS (PROCESS STATUS )
PID  = PROCESS ID  
TTY =   NAME OF THE CONTROLLING TERMINAL FOR THE PROCESS
TIME = cummulative cpu time for the process
cmd =    command

                                     LISTING AL PROCESSES 
                                     PS -C 

                    full listing format and display detailed information about the process
                                     ps-f 

                                      ps -ef

                     all procsses with detailed information

UID = USERS WHO RUN THE PROCESS 
Pid = process ID 
ppid = parent process id 
stime = starting time for the process

NOTE: if there is a question mark (?) it means the process does not have a terminal to which it is attached . it either a system services or deamon


                                                    AUX COMMAND 
                             PS -AUX  OR PS AUX
            the ps aux command can show processes running on a system as well as the , THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT IT INVOLVES memory usages , cpu and more 

when the above command is run the following occurs
1. USER
2. PID
3. %CPU  =  The cpu % for the process 
4. %MEM = the memory % for the process (ration of process set size to physical memory of the machine)
5. VSZ  = vritual memorize size in KB
6. RSS = side of the physical memory that the proceess is using  , includes memory from shared libraries 
7. TTY
8. STAT = indicates the process state ( s = sleeping , r= running  z = zombie t= stopped i= idle kernel thread <= high priorty  N = low priortity  )
9. start = 
10.TIME
11. COMMAND 
                    
                                                  RUNNINR PROCESS
            when they tell you your cpu has 4 or 8 cores it memans that not more than 4 processes can run simultaneoulsy 
                                                   

                                                     processes scheduling
it is described as running processes simultaneoulsy  (CRUD process)

                                                  SORTING PROCESSES 

for example you want to sort processes to see the memory used by  memorey , virtual size or rss . then the following command can be run 

for example sorting by memory usage ps aux --sort = %mem   sort in ascending order  or to sort in descending order  ps aux --sort = -%mem   sort in ascending order
 

                                                  PROCESS OF A SPECIFIC USER 
TO view all the process involved with a specific users , do the following;
