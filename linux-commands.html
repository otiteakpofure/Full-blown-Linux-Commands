##updating 

sudo apt update = for update all packages

####to upgrade all application to their 

sudo apt full-upgrade 


####executing script in linux (there are other ways)

sudo bash (and the name of the file)

#####to open terminal

ctrl + alt + t


###to list the network interfaces you can use this command 

ip a or ip link (and these interfacess are usually called  Wired connection 1, eth0 or ens18)


##to edit network setting on the ubuntu server you check the netplan configuration file and these files are usually called (01-netcfg.yaml or 50-cloud-init.yaml:) 
##this configuration file is a YAML file and in this netplan file you can add more ip addresses or any configuration settings

## to save aand close a file 

ctrl +o and ctrl + x 


############to check the changes to make on any file in link the  try command is used  so to check if a file as the user 

sudo try  ( name of the the file you want to check)





#################to check if the changes have been made on the file you want to check

sudo (filename) apply


############if you cant use the netplan file you can therefore use these command below to make changes to the configuration 

nmcli 



##########to list the number of connections 

nmcli connection show



####to add multiple addresses using the nmcli ( run the ip a or ip link command to see the present NIC on your server it can be 
wiredconnection1 or eth8 or ens18)  #####so to add the multiple addresses the followiung command can be ran 

$ sudo nmcli connection modify '(the name of the interface (Wired connection 1)' +ipv4.addresses "( the list of ip address like these 192.168.1.22/24,192.168.1.23/24,192.168.1.24/24)"



## to check if the changes have been applied for the nmcli use the followuing command 

$ sudo nmcli connection down ' (the name of the interface (Wired connection 1)'
$ sudo nmcli connection up '(the name of the interface (Wired connection )1'


to check if the address  has been added with the nmcli 

nmcli con show 'Wired connection 1 (the name of the interface)'


in linux you can add two commands using the following

&&



the bash is the shell of linux and gnome terminal execute bash 


to test network connectivity you use the following command

ping 

and to check how many times the ping should work will be the following command

ping -c number ( should be a numberical number to represent the amount of times should be pinged) and the Ip address 


it is either called localhost or loop back which is 127.0.0.1 



###TO DISPLAY INFORMATION ABOUT THE FILE SYSTEM AND THE DISKSAPCE USAGE 

df 


##TO CHECK IF A COMMAND IS AN EXECTABLE FILE RUN THE COMMAND

type ( and the name of the command) for exampme (type man) if it has a file path you know its executable and 
has a man page and if it does not have a file path know that it is built into linux and to check the man page of the built in command 
use this <command>

    help (and the name of the command) for example help UMASK;



                                                   USING TAB 

you can use tab for autocompletion but if you are searching for something and 
there are multiple of its for example lets state a folder with the name pass

if you press the tab once it will not do anything because there are multiple of its 

so press tab twice which TAB TAB 



###to download a file use from the internet or a server  use the comman below  

WGET 



To suspends a process in linux 

use ctrl + z 



                                                                   BASH COMMAND HISTORY 

to check all the commands a user has run check the (bash_history) file  and the number of commands size is called echo HISTFILESIZE and can save up to 2000

or run the  (HISTORY)command 

HISTSIZE  controls the number of commands that can be saved in a file 

bash saves maximum 2000 commands in the HISTFILESIZE and maximum 1000 commands in memory when the HISTORY command is executed

After you open the bash_history file and yiu want to run a command from the history file using numnber 20 as the example
you do the command 

                              !(the number of the command on the file)



and to rerun the last command run use this command   using two exclamation marks 

(!!)


To check for a command in history and run it from the history for example its ping run the command ( !ping) BUT THIS WILL EXECUTE THE COMMAND 
but if you do not want to execute the command but do the same thing , do the following below

and as well as this applies to also running the code from history without running it 
for example its a ping command you do  it just print the command without executing it 

                        ( !ping:p)


to check for a command run in bash history , for example you want to check for  the ping command in history 

you press   CTRL + R and it will display a (reverse-i-searched)' ' between the exclamation marks you put the command you are searching for 



to remOve a command from history for example number 20 command you run the following 

                                      HISTORY-D (THE LINE NUMBER OF THE COMMAND)

to clear the whole history file , the followuing command can be pressed 

                                                history -c 


 to run a command that should not be saved in history  so that they 

  first create a space and then run the command for exampple   ( create  space by pressing tab key and ping) with these in place , 
  this wont be saved in history

  but MAINLY YOU CAN USE VARIABLE CALLED 

 ####### PLEASE NOT THIS IS FOR CENT OS and ubuntu
  HISTCONTROL  = ignoreboth;
  HISTCONTROL  = ignorespace;





  ####TO DETERMINE WHO IS LOGGED INTO THE SYSTEM  OR THE  USER LOGGED IN 

  use the (who) command 


  IF YOU WANT TO CHECK THE LOGGED IN USER AND THE GROUP THE USER BELONGS TO RUN THE 

  ID COMMAND 

  the difference between who and id is that id shows the user, group, its id while who just shows the name of the user 
  
  




RECORDING TIME AND DATE FOR TIME FOR COMMANDS RUN IN THE HISTORY FILE 


HISTTIMEFORMAT = '%d/%m/%y %T'


BASH RC = ANY CONFIGURATION YOU MAKE ON LINUX AND YOU WANT TO SAVE IT IN LINUX PERManantly it is done 
                                   in the bash rc file . 

for example to save the HISTTIMEFORMAT
do the following 

 echo  HISTTIMEFORMAT = '%d/%m/%y %T'  >> .bash rc






ROOT AND NON-ROOT USERS 

NON-ROOT USERS ARE SAVED IN THE HOME DIRECTORY AND ROOT USERS SHOULD NOT BE USED IN NON-ADMINISTRATIIVE TASK 


TO BE SUPER USER RUN THE COMMAND and also activate the root environment    on cent OS SUDO IS CALLED WHEEL 

                      SUDO su -



            USERS AND ROOT 

In linux , users are known by $ while root is know by #  and it is also denoted by /


                                      GROUP and USER CREATION
To create a group on ubuntu run the command appending the group name for example the group is called management  and user john

                                groupadd management
                                useradd john

if you are logged in as sudo and you dont want to keep using the password each time and NOTE THIS LAST FOR 5 MINUTES 
run this command    

                                          sudo -v 

the next command you run will not ask for password and this last for five minutes 

and if you want it to stop after 5 minutes , run this command 

                                       sudo -k
 

                                           PASSWORD 
To change a passeord in LINUX

for example the name of the user is kelvin
                                         sudo passwd kelvin

NOTE ON CENT OS THE ROOT PASSWROD IS SET AT INSTALLATION TIME 

THE ROOT DIRECTORY IS  /root/ so if you want to go to the root directory of root accounty 

run cd /root/

and if you want to go to the root of users run /home/ 


                                    THE LINUX FILE SYSTEM
