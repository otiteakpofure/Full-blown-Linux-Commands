sudo (filename) apply


############if you cant use the netplan file you can therefore use these command below to make changes to the configuration 

nmcli 



##########to list the number of connections 

nmcli connection show



####to add multiple addresses using the nmcli ( run the ip a or ip link command to see the present NIC on your server it can be 
wiredconnection1 or eth8 or ens18)  #####so to add the multiple addresses the followiung command can be ran 

$ sudo nmcli connection modify '(the name of the interface (Wired connection 1)' +ipv4.addresses "( the list of ip address like these 192.168.1.22/24,192.168.1.23/24,192.168.1.24/24)"



## to check if the changes have been applied for the nmcli use the followuing command 

$ sudo nmcli connection down ' (the name of the interface (Wired connection 1)'
$ sudo nmcli connection up '(the name of the interface (Wired connection )1'


to check if the address  has been added with the nmcli 

nmcli con show 'Wired connection 1 (the name of the interface)'


in linux you can add two commands using the following

use this <command>

    help (and the name of the command) for example help UMASK;



    USING TAB

BASH COMMAND HISTORY 

to check all the commands a user has run check the (bash_history) file  and the number of commands size is called echo HISTFILESIZE and can save up to 2000

or run the history command 

HISTSIZE  controls the number of commands that can be saved in a file 

bash saves maximum 2000 commands in the HISTFILESIZE and maximum 1000 commands in memory when the HISTORY command is executed

After you open the bash_history file and yiu want to run a command from the file using numnber 20 as the example
you do the command 

                              !(the number of the command on the file)



and to rerun the last command run use this command   using two exclamation marks 

(!!)


to check for command and ensure it is right before executing it the following should be done 

for example its a ping command you do  it just print the command without executing it 

                        ( !ping:p)


to check for a command run in bash history , for example you want to check for  the ping command in history 

you press   CTRL + R and it will display a (reverse-i-searched)' ' between the exclamation marks you put the command you are searching for
