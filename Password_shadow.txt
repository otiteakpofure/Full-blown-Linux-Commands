     1= Md5 
     2a = Blowfish 
     2y = eksblowfish 
     5= shA 256

           check to see if you see more users having the student then you can know all of them are in the same group 

NOTE : In Linux a file is owned by both the users and group and others.  A user can be a memeber of zero or none secondary groups 


to ensure uses have a certain permissions , the users must be added to certain groups
