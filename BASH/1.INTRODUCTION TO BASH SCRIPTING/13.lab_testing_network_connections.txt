for example , you want to use your machine to check if your network gateway is still working or to check its connection to another
computer on your server 

 you can test 

 #!/bin/bash
 output = "$(ping -c 3 )"
 #echo "$output"

 if [[ "$output" == *"100% packet loss"*]]
 then 

    echo " connection is working"

 else 
    echo " connection is not working"

fi
