variable in bash 

                     creating a variable in bash 

for example, you want to create a variable called os , then you can do os=linux 

NOTE: YIU DO NOT NEED SPACE BETWEEN THE VARIABLES

IF linux was going to be written as i love linux 

         os = "i love linux"

NOTE: BASH DOES NOT REQURED TO STATE WHAT TYPE OF VARIBLE AND IN BASH THERE ARE NO FLOATING POITN NUMBERS 


VARIBALE NAME CONVENTIONS 

CANNOT START WITH A NUMBER
DO NOT USE SPECIAL CHARACTERS

                                    SHOWING OUTPUT OF A VARIABLES

To show the output of a variable, then do the following:

   to show it use $andthenameofthevarbiale 

   for example, if the varibale is called man , then run $man 

   this will show the name of the variable 



NOTE: To reference a variable inside a string enclise everything in "". for example, if the variblae name is called man , to refernece it in a string do the following:

                                     "i am a  $man"


NOTE: IT IS MUST BE DOUBLE QUOTES 

                                         USING \ 

FOR EXAMPLE , YOU WANT TO WRITE $OS AND ALSO ENSURE IT REMAINS $OS IN THE TEXT 

BY USING \ IT WILL ALLOW IT TO REMAIN THE SAME 

                           "I AM A MAN WITH \$OS"



 A VARIBALE CAN HOLD MORE THAN ONE VARIBLAE , FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE A VARIABLE CALLED 

 $1= CAR 
 $2 = MAN

 and you can create a 3rd varible which will have the following 

                whatname = "$! AND $2" 

                THIS whatname will hold the values for two of them 

                     GET A LIST OF ALL FUNCTIONS AND VARIABLE 

                     set command 

                     NOTE: THIS SHOWS ALL THE VARIABLES SET BY YOU 
To see the list of functions and variable set by you  , run the set command 



                         UNSET COMMAND  = IT is used to remove a variable which is set by you 


                           ENVIRONMENTAL SHELL VARIABLES THAT ARE INTRODUCED BY THE OS  OR STARTUP SCRIPTS

FOR EXAMPLE CHECKING THE HOME , USER OR HISORYT 


 echo $HOME 
 echo $HISTORY 

                      TO ENSURE A VARIABLE REMAINS CONSTANT
To ensure a variable remains constant,  and does not change , the use of declare 

                         declare -r thenameofthevariable = "thevalueofthevariable"

NOTE: This makes it read only and cannot be changed
