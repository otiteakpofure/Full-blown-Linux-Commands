functions to organize cods in block and ensure our programs can  be used for later

NOTE: AS  compared to other languages , bash functions are somehow limited


                          USING BASH functions
There are two different format to display a function:

1. function andthenameofthefunction

             function andthenameofthefunction (){

             }

or second way : yu can just write the name of the function without stating the name 

nameofthefcuntion(){

}

NOTE IN BASH : DO NOT EVER PUT ANYTHING INTO () IN BASH SCRIPTS


 CREATING A FUNCTION WITH ARGUMENTS 


  creatfiles(){
    echo"creating firsst file $1"
  }

  # so to add arguments do the following

  creatfiles  bb.txt

NOTE: BASH Functions use the return statement just to print out the last line  , a return status of zero indicated evertything went successfully and  non-zero value imdicates everything an error has occured 

                        using the return value 

$? = CONTAINS THE STATUS OF THRE PREVIOUSLY RUN FUNCTION


NOTE: GREP -C = FINDS THE NUMBER OF OCURRENCE OF A PATTERN IN A FILE 
       for example grep -c "james" = this will find the number of occurences of james in a file.  


RETURN : YOU CAN USE RETURN STATEMENT BUT ONLY AS A COMMAND subsitiion
