                                                          VIEWING ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
You can also view environment variables and also the values of the ENVIRONMENTAL variable by using PRINTENV command 


to use the printenv command , run the printenv command and the name of the environment variable you want to check:

                                   printenv (thenameoftheenvironmentalvariable)

NOTE: YOU CAN APPEND MORE THAN ONE ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLE TO THE PRINTENV COMMAND 

                                            SET COMMAND 

The set command is used to display the output of the variable set by the user and also the variables set by environmental variables 

NOTE: ENvronmental variables can be sued when you want to change the default settings of your system

running the set -o POSIX allows the set command to show the varibals you sert and environment variables 



for example , you create various scripts in a directory and instead of writing each directory name by using the ./ command name , you can run them by just writin the
name of the directory and the scripts in that direcoryt will be executed , to do this you can do the following:



to do this open the .bashrc file and underwrite 

                            export PATH = $PATH : AND THE DIRECOTY YOU WANT TO ADD 

note: when this directory is placed instead of running scripts by adding ./ it can be run by using its normal name 


                                    CRATING A NEW ENVIONRMENT VARIBAL ENVIONRMENT

                    in the bashrc folder run 

                     export thenameofthevaraibel = thevalueofthevaribale 


and if you want the new variable created by you to be avialble to all suers then do this in the /etc/bash.bashrc file 

                                                        /etc/environment
