command substitution is not more than running a shell command and storing it in a variable for later use 
IT IS simply running  a command and storiung it in a variable

                     FORMS OF COMMAND substitution

1. `WRITINNT THE COMMAND WITHING THOSE BACKTICKS` note : because the output is a string variable, then use double quotes  
             for example man = "`ls -l`"

2. wirting the command between  $(command)

                 for man = "$(who)"

3.   you can append a command subsitiion inside plenty commands. for example, you want to ctreate various date for backups 

    for example , the etc folder so this can be:  etc $(date +F %M%H)
