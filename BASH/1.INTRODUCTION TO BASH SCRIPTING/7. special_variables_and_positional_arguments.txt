  in many cases , 

  ARGUMENTS 

  These are seperated, fields which make them unique to the script,  

                                  SPECIAL VARIABLE AND or  POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS 

  there are various predefined variables IN LINUX which are explained below:


  ./script.sh filename dir1 10.0.0.1

 $0 = name of the script itself (script.sh)
 $1 = first positional argument (filename1)
 $2 = second positional argument (dir1)
 $3 = third positional argument (10.0.0.1)
 $9= would be ninth arugument and ${10} the tenth 

NOTE: After the ninth argument , the argument after should be in {}

 $# = number of positional arguments
 "$*"= string representation of all positional arguments: $1 $2 
 $? = most recent foreground command exit status ( CONTAINS STATUS OF THE PREVIOUS RUN FUNCTION)



 NOTE: YOU CAN ADD ANYTHING TO THE ARGUMENTS EVEN A FILE PATH OR A DIRECTORY ITSELF
