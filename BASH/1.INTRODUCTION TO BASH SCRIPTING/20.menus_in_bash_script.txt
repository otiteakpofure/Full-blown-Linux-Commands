creating bash menus generate a list of items from 


select ITEM in LISt
do 
commands 
done 


note: in menus, the loop does not end except the user , pressers ctrl +c or there is  abreak 

lets look at creatine menus 

select country in germanay france "east sprain "
do 
    echo $country
    echo $reply
done 

the way this works , is if the the counrty are printed tho the screen after the last line which is east sprain, then the #? shows
this means that the user is meant to select either one of the country display on the screen
gernmany means 1 , france means 2 , east sprain means 3 

so if the user selects 1 it will show in the reply varibale that is created automatically .
