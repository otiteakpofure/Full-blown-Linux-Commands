remember in bash there are only integers 
 run man test and check for integers

 a. INTERGER1 -eq INTERGER2  =  interger1 is equal to   interger2
 b. INTERGER1 -ge INTERGER2 = interger1 is greater than or equal to interger2
 c. INTERGER1 -gt INTERGER2 = interger1 is greater than interger2
 d. INTERGER1 -Le INTERGER2 = interger1 is LESS than OR EQUALT TO interger2
 e. INTERGER1 -lt INTERGER2 = interger1 is less than interger2
 f. INTERGER1 -ne INTERGER2 = interger1 is not equal to interger2
 h. file1 -ef file2 = file1 and file2 have the same device and inode numbers
