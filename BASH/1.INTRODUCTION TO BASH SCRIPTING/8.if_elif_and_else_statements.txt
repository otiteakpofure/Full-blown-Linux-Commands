programming flow logic and allow to execute 


if[some condtion here]
then 
  //execute some code here 
elif[some condtion here]
then 
//execute some code here
else
//execute some code here
fi   


NOTE: IT IS NOT MANDATORY TO HAVE AN  ELIF OR ELSE STATEMENT 
    IT IS MANDATORY TO HAVE A SPACE  AFTER THE IF STATMENT BEFORE THE CONIDITION FOR EXAMPLE SHOW BELOW
    THERE IS SPACE BAFTER THE IF STATMENT AND BEFORE THE CONDITION WRITTEN 

                                  IF [ SOME CONDITION HERE ]

fi is similar to closing brace 

                                       using  -f  and -d 

using -f returns true only if the value after it is a file , it is as testing condition  and -d returns true only if it is a directory 
  for example 

                     if [ -f checkingifthevaribleisafile]
for example if man is a file  

                      if [ -f "man"] NOTE: it is necessary to place $man in a string because it is considered a string 


NOTE: TO CHECK ALL TESTING CONDITIONS , RUN man test 

                                                    SINGLE SQUARE BRACKET []VS DOUBLE SQUARE BRACKET [[]]

SINGLE SQUARE BRACKET ARE USED FOR TESTING CONDITIONS BUT IT IS OLD BUT PREFERBLY USING [[]] IS BETTER AND SAFER TO TESTING , IT PREVENTS STRING SPACING
