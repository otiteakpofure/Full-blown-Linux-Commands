                       THE WHILE LOOP 
while CONDITION
do
   COMMANDS 

done

the set of command s are executed as long as the condition is true

for example create a bash script to check if the condition is true, 



i=0

while [[ $i -lt 10]]   
do 
   echo $i   
       ((i++))
done 

                                adding two variables 

for example , you want to add a variable: when doing arithmentic operations

a = 5
b= 6 

         c= $((a+b))
         echo $c                          which is the same  let c = a +b

NOTE: ENSURE THE LOOP DOES NOT REMAIN INFINITELY 
                                               OR INFINITE LOOP CAN BE CREATED USING :

                                               WHILE : 

THE COMMAND ABOVE CREATES AND INFINITE LOOP

                             WHILE TRUE IS EQUALS TO WHILE :
