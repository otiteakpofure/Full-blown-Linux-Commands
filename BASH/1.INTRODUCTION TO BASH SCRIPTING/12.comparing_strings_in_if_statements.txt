As a common administrtaive command , you can compore the output of a string and another string and base on the report , you can act accrodingly . 

                  COMPARING STRINGS IN BASH 
Two strings are equal when they have the same length and contain the same sequence of characters in the same order.  

                           the comparison operator for string
the comparison operator for string is the = if []  or == if [[]] is used 

FOR EXAMPLE  : IF ["STR1" = "STR2"]

                                  checking how a sting contains a substring 
there are multiple ways to do it but these are few;
 what this means for example you have  string called "man of the world", so to check if this string has for example "man" in it thats what this means  

1. surrouding the substing with * which means match all characters:

 let say , you have a string   

    str1 = "man of the world" 

     if [ [ "$str1" == *"man"*]]

     then 
         echo "there is a man in the world"


                                             CHECK IF A STRING RESULTING FROM ANOTHER OPERATION
YOU WANT TO CHECK IF A STRING RESULTING FROM ANOTHER OPERATION . FOR EXAMPLE COMMAND subsitiion

you can do this by using - n = if the string is more than zero then the string returns true  (string non-zero length)
                        -z = if it zero and return true   (string zero length)

            

            for example, 

                      my_str = "abc"

    if [ [ -z  "$my-str"]]
       then 
            echo "the string is zero|"
