                         the for loop 

the for statement is used to execute a block of operation 

 for item in LIST 
 do 
  COMMANDS 

   done 

   the list can be a series of strings, seperated by spaces , a  range of numbers , output of a command , an array and so on 


   NOTE: THE LIST IS A SERIES OF STRINGS, seperated by spaces.

   for example 

   for os in ubuntu linux
   do 
   echo "$os"
   done

   NOTE : IF ONE OF THE ELEMENT IN THE ABOVE LIST CONTAINS A SPACE , then that element should be enclosed in "" what i mean is this  which is shown below 



    for os in ubuntu linux "fedora version22"
   do 
   echo "$os"
   done

done 


                                                       Incrementing through a list of NUMBERS
for example, you want to go through a range of numbers, using an increment of 5 , you can do this by using: 


for num in {30..70..5}

do 

    echo "num is $num"
done 

NOTE: ./* means any file in the current directory  WHILE *.TXT OR *.DIR WHICH MEANS ALL FILES IN TXT FILES IN THE CURRENT DIRECTORY


                                                 CREATING A STRING THAT RENAME A FILE

FOR FILE IN *.TXT 
do 
   mv"$file" "renamed_by_script_$file"
done 

NOTE: YOU CAN ALSO WRITE SCRIPTS IN OTHER PROGRAMMING LANUGAUES BUT YOU CAN WRITE THOSE SCRIPT IN USING SHEBANG
