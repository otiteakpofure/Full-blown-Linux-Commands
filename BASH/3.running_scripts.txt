There are different ways of running bash scripts 

1. add execution permission to the file and add the abolute path 


ANOTHER WAY TO RUN THE SCRIPT:
To run a script  the use of the interpreter can be used:

for example you want to run bash , it will be   

                           bash thenameofthescript

if its python , you can run the same thing python3 andthenameofthescript

NOTE: When using this method it is not mandatory to have the execution permission set 

                                  USING THE SOURCE COMMAND 

To run the file , the source command can be used:

this involves using the 

                           source andthenameofthescript

for example, the script is called james.sh 

                           source james.sh 

NOTE: When you use the path variable to execute script such ./nameofthescript and source andthenameofthescript . the difference is the firs opens

a new terminal in which the scriot will be run while the second one does not do that 


instead of using source andthenameofthescript , you can as well use  . (spacebetweenthem) andthenameofthescript
