linux knows files by the file header  in linux most file do not have extensions 

shadow = stores users password 
group = stores the group 
executiable files = does not have extensions
                                  FILE 
.log = log files
.conf = configuration files
.bin = executable files  


                                       TO CHECK THE TYPE OF FILE 
Run the file and path to the file 

    file (the path to the file )
                                       TO RENAME A FILE  by chaning the file extension
    for example the file is name.jpeg   

    mv path to thenfile name.jpeg    (this is the initial file ext)  filename.png ( the new file ext)


    NOTE : You cant rename a file by the GuI and extension are only useful for graphical applications 



                                                      EXTENSION NAME 

- = filetype
d = directory
l = symbolic link   or @
b = block device 
c = char device 
s= socket = processes to communicate not to do with tcp/ip  or =
p = named pipe  =   which is the normal | 

                                                 CLASSIFY A FILE 
to classify a file  =  ls - F  ( this will add the symbol notification like / to the file  music/ = directory)
as well it also add an asterix to executable files 
                                                CHECKING FOR FILES IN A DIRECTORY AND
if you want to see files in a directory , you can do this by 
                                                         file/run/*


                                                         VIEWING FILES
CAT COMMAND = can display two files  by  cat /etc/local/  /etc/var/ 
cat -n = also presents the line number 
more = for viewing the a big file one screen at a time
less = for viewing  abig file one page at a time 

                                                     TAIL COMMAND 
tail  = shows 10 last lines of the file 
head = shows 10 first lines of the file

FOR EXAMPLe you want to see the last two lines of a file for example the file is called man.txt 
                                 tail -n 2 man.txt   

                                                   READING FROM A SPECIFIC LINE NUMNER 
tail -n +20 and the path to the file 

                                                  RUNNING TAIL COMMAND TO UPDATING IN REAL TIME
To see updates in real time or changes to a document instantly, run 

                        tail -f and path to the file 


                                                    CREATING A FILE INTO FROM CAT 
for example there are 2 files next.txt and fist.txt 
                      cat next.txt fist.txt > second.txt 

 h = for help 
 q= quit 
                                                         SEARCHING FOR A STRING IN A FILE 

 
For example the string is man = to search for the string  type =  \man  mathces will be highlighted and press n to navigate  and M to go back 
NOTE : The \ is used at the beginning of the file 
? is used at the bottom of the file 

                                                               RUNNING THE HEAD 

                                                 
  FOR EXAMPLe you want to see the first two lines of a file for example the file is called man.txt 
                                                               head -n 2 man.txt 

                                                                  WATCH COMMAND 
To run a command to while displayin a command error and output , the watch command should be used
NOTE: This is not for files , it is for command 
                                          watch ls 
TO watch the change to the file every 3 seconds or depending on the seconds you choose 
                                       watch -n 3  -d ls 

                                        CREATING FILES AND DIRECTORIES 
when creating directory and to see the output how that directory was created run 
                                            mkdir -v
to creat directories like for example three directories 
1 , 2 3 

 mkdir -p /1/2/3
 

                                 - F 

this command add the filetype at the end of the file : Please not it is capital F 





Directory	Description
/	Primary hierarchy root and root directory of the entire file system hierarchy.
/bin	Essential command binaries that need to be available in single-user mode, including to bring up the system or repair it,[3] for all users (e.g., cat, ls, cp).
/boot	Boot loader files (e.g., kernels, initrd).
/dev	Device files (e.g., /dev/null, /dev/disk0, /dev/sda1, /dev/tty, /dev/random).
/etc	Host-specific system-wide configuration files.
There has been controversy over the meaning of the name itself. In early versions of the UNIX Implementation Document from Bell Labs, /etc is referred to as the etcetera directory,[4] as this directory historically held everything that did not belong elsewhere (however, the FHS restricts /etc to static configuration files and may not contain binaries).[5] Since the publication of early documentation, the directory name has been re-explained in various ways. Recent interpretations include backronyms such as "Editable Text Configuration" or "Extended Tool Chest".[6]

/etc/opt	Configuration files for add-on packages stored in /opt.
/etc/sgml	Configuration files, such as catalogs, for software that processes SGML.
/etc/X11	Configuration files for the X Window System, version 11.
/etc/xml	Configuration files, such as catalogs, for software that processes XML.
/home	Users' home directories, containing saved files, personal settings, etc.
/lib	Libraries essential for the binaries in /bin and /sbin.
/lib<qual>	Alternate format essential libraries. These are typically used on systems that support more than one executable code format, such as systems supporting 32-bit and 64-bit versions of an instruction set. Such directories are optional, but if they exist, they have some requirements.
/media	Mount points for removable media such as CD-ROMs (appeared in FHS-2.3 in 2004).
/mnt	Temporarily mounted filesystems.
/opt	Add-on application software packages.[7]
/proc	Virtual filesystem providing process and kernel information as files. In Linux, corresponds to a procfs mount. Generally, automatically generated and populated by the system, on the fly.
/root	Home directory for the root user.
/run	Run-time variable data: Information about the running system since last boot, e.g., currently logged-in users and running daemons. Files under this directory must be either removed or truncated at the beginning of the boot process, but this is not necessary on systems that provide this directory as a temporary filesystem (tmpfs).
/sbin	Essential system binaries (e.g., fsck, init, route).
/srv	Site-specific data served by this system, such as data and scripts for web servers, data offered by FTP servers, and repositories for version control systems (appeared in FHS-2.3 in 2004).
/sys	Contains information about devices, drivers, and some kernel features.[8]
/tmp	Directory for temporary files (see also /var/tmp). Often not preserved between system reboots and may be severely size-restricted.
/usr	Secondary hierarchy for read-only user data; contains the majority of (multi-)user utilities and applications. Should be shareable and read-only.[9][10]
/usr/bin	Non-essential command binaries (not needed in single-user mode); for all users.
/usr/include	Standard include files.
/usr/lib	Libraries for the binaries in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin.
/usr/libexec	Binaries run by other programs that are not intended to be executed directly by users or shell scripts (optional).
/usr/lib<qual>	Alternative-format libraries (e.g., /usr/lib32 for 32-bit libraries on a 64-bit machine (optional)).
/usr/local	Tertiary hierarchy for local data, specific to this host. Typically has further subdirectories (e.g., bin, lib, share).[NB 1]
/usr/sbin	Non-essential system binaries (e.g., daemons for various network services).
/usr/share	Architecture-independent (shared) data.
/usr/src	Source code (e.g., the kernel source code with its header files).
/usr/X11R6	X Window System, Version 11, Release 6 (up to FHS-2.3, optional).
/var	Variable files: files whose content is expected to continually change during normal operation of the system, such as logs, spool files, and temporary e-mail files.
/var/cache	Application cache data. Such data are locally generated as a result of time-consuming I/O or calculation. The application must be able to regenerate or restore the data. The cached files can be deleted without loss of data.
/var/lib	State information. Persistent data modified by programs as they run (e.g., databases, packaging system metadata, etc.).
/var/lock	Lock files. Files keeping track of resources currently in use.
/var/log	Log files. Various logs.
/var/mail	Mailbox files. In some distributions, these files may be located in the deprecated /var/spool/mail.
/var/opt	Variable data from add-on packages that are stored in /opt.
/var/run	Run-time variable data. This directory contains system information data describing the system since it was booted.[11]
In FHS 3.0, /var/run is replaced by /run; a system should either continue to provide a /var/run directory or provide a symbolic link from /var/run to /run for backwards compatibility.[12]

/var/spool	Spool for tasks waiting to be processed (e.g., print queues and outgoing mail queue).
/var/spool/mail	Deprecated location for users' mailboxes.[13]
/var/tmp	Temporary files to be preserved between reboots.
