linux knows files by the file header  in linux most file do not have extensions 

shadow = stores users password 
group = stores the group 
executiable files = does not have extensions
                                  FILE 
.log = log files
.conf = conf files


                                       TO CHECK THE TYPE OF FILE 
Run the file and path to the file 

    file (the path to the file )
                                       TO RENAME A FILE  by chaning the file extension
    for example the file is name.jpeg   

    mv path to thenfile name.jpeg    (this is the initial file ext)  filename.png ( the new file ext)


    NOTE : You cant rename a file by the GuI and extension are only useful for graphical applications
