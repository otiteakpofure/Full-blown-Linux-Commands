linux knows files by the file header  in linux most file do not have extensions 

shadow = stores users password 
group = stores the group 
executiable files = does not have extensions
                                  FILE 
.log = log files
.conf = conf files


                                       TO CHECK THE TYPE OF FILE 
Run the file and path to the file 

    file (the path to the file )
                                       TO RENAME A FILE  by chaning the file extension
    for example the file is name.jpeg   

    mv path to thenfile name.jpeg    (this is the initial file ext)  filename.png ( the new file ext)


    NOTE : You cant rename a file by the GuI and extension are only useful for graphical applications 



                                                      EXTENSION NAME 

- = filetype
d = directory
l = symbolic link   or @
b = block device 
c = char device 
s= socket = processes to communicate not to do with tcp/ip  or =
p = named pipe  =   which is the normal | 

                                                 CLASSIFY A FILE 
to classify a file  =  ls - F  ( this will add the symbol notification like / to the file  music/ = directory)
as well it also add an asterix to executable files 
                                                CHECKING FOR FILES IN A DIRECTORY AND
if you want to see files in a directory , you can do this by 
                                                         file/run/*


                                                         VIEWING FILES
CAT COMMAND = can display two files  by  cat /etc/local/  /etc/var/ 
cat -n = also presents the line number 
more = for viewing the a big file one screen at a time
less = for viewing  abig file one page at a time 

                                                     TAIL COMMAND 
tail  = shows 10 last lines of the file 
head = shows 10 first lines of the file

FOR EXAMPLe you want to see the last two lines of a file for example the file is called man.txt 
                                 tail -n 2 man.txt   

                                                   READING FROM A SPECIFIC LINE NUMNER 
tail -n +20 and the path to the file 

                                                  RUNNING TAIL COMMAND TO UPDATING IN REAL TIME
To see updates in real time or changes to a document instantly, run 

                        tail -f and path to the file 


                                                    CREATING A FILE INTO FROM CAT 
for example there are 2 files next.txt and fist.txt 
                      cat next.txt fist.txt > second.txt 

 h = for help 
 q= quit 
                                                         SEARCHING FOR A STRING IN A FILE 

 
For example the string is man = to search for the string  type =  \man  mathces will be highlighted and press n to navigate  and M to go back 
NOTE : The \ is used at the beginning of the file 
? is used at the bottom of the file 

                                                               RUNNING THE HEAD 

                                                 
  FOR EXAMPLe you want to see the first two lines of a file for example the file is called man.txt 
                                                               head -n 2 man.txt 

                                                                  WATCH COMMAND 
To run a command to while displayin a command error and output , the watch command should be used
NOTE: This is not for files , it is for command 
                                          watch ls 
TO watch the change to the file every 3 seconds or depending on the seconds you choose 
                                       watch -n 3  -d ls 

                                        CREATING FILES AND DIRECTORIES 
when creating directory and to see the output how that directory was created run 
                                            mkdir -v
