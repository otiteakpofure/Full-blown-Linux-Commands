if youw ant to completely flush the iptables rules and create a fresh iotables state , you should set the accept policy on all chains and delete all iptables users defined chains 

foreward chains is used for routed pacektes and that means the linux machine is also the function of the routter 

to deleta a firewall do the following , THIS DOESN NOT ESSENTIALLY DELETE THE FIREWALL , IT CLEARS ALL POLICY AND CHAINS WRITTEN FOR PACKERS AND 
RETURNS IPTABLES TO THE ORIGINAL STATES WHEN THE MACHINE WAS BOOTED WITHOUT THE ALTERLING THE FIREWALL 


1. set the accept polciu 

iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT 
iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT 
iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT


2.flush all tables 

iptables -t filter -F 
iptables -t nat -F
iptables -t mangle -F
iptables -t raw -F

NPTE: IF THE TABLE HAS NO RULE NOTHING HAPPENS 

NOTE: THE THIRD STEPS IS OPTIONAL AND ONLY USED IF THERE ARE USER DEFINED CHAINS 


3 DELETE USER DEFINED CHAINS
iptabbles - X

note: if uyou are using ipset to drop large collection of ipaddress like entire countries you can alsos flush and delete the set.
