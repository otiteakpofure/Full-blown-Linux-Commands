packets state

1.new = the first packet from a connection . i.e packets requesting a new connection , or the packets set  , firs packet of any connection
2. established = packets that are part of an existing connection i.e second packets are in this state 
3.  related = packets that are requesting a new connection and are already part of an exisitng connection ie requesting a new connection after being part of a old connectio 
4. invalid = packets that are not part of any existing connection i.e packets are not identified and part of any conenction, good idea to drop everything in this state
5. untracked = packets markeed within the raw table with the NOTRACk tARGET 

                              to match packets based on their statest
use the command:

                      iptables -A INPUT -m state --state nameofthestate yowant -j ACCEPT
