LOG is a non-terminating target 
it logs detailed information about packet headers 
logs can be read with dmesg of from syslogd daemon
log is used instead of drop for debuigging phase 
ULOG has Mysql support 

if a packet is matched against the log target the packet headers are logged and the packet continues to traverse till it mathced by a rule set 
LOG target is specially designed for obtaining detailed information about packet headers,  it does this via the kernlel logginf facility , which can be read from 
syslogd daemon or message 

NOTE: THE LOG Tagert is VERY USEFUL when testing firewalls , it is useful to replace the DROP packer when you create a firewall 
      on a production machine and testing to see if its working 
      a syntax error can cause severe production problems


The log target takes two options 

--log-prefix  = tells Iptables to prefix all log messages with a speific prefix or string whuch can be combined with grep to find specific problems or output from different rules 
--log-level = indicates the priority and severity of the log

example: iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -dport nameofhheport --syn -j LOG --LOG-prefix = "place any string here" --log-level info

FOR EXAMPLE, LOGGINF NEW SSH TRAFFIC 
for example, you want to login new ssh traffic, so as get information about tcp traffic 

iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 --syn -j LOG --log-prefix = "incoming ssh traffic" --log-level info 

THIS MEANS THE MATCHED PACKET WILL CONTINUE TO TRAVERS THE DOM 

                               kernel logs 
TO SEE THE FIREWALL LOGS RUN dmesg 



in ubuntu all kernels logs are found in 

                                      tail -f /var/log/kern.log
                                      -f means it will show data of the file in realtime
