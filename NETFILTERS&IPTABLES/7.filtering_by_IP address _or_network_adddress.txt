1. match by source IP or network address 

Match:-s , IP --source IP
example: iptables -A INPUT -s placethesubnetofaddress -j DROP 


2. Match by Destination IP or network address

Match:-d , IP --destination IP
Example: iptables -A FORWARD -s placethesubnetofaddress -j DROP 
        iptables -A OUTPUT -d nameofthewebstite (like www.ubuntu.com) -j DROP  NOTE: USING THIS METHOD IS NOT ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA 



DROPPING ALL INCONIMING TRAFFIC FROM ANOTHER IPADRESS 

iptabls -A INPUT -s theipaddress -j DROP 


                                          DROOPING BY DESTINATION address
THIS DROPS TRAFFIC GOING TO  A PARTICULAR ADDRESS 

                                   DROPPING PACKETS GOING TO A WEBSITE
 dropping packets going to a webiste , involves lookingfor the wesbiste ips to deny access to the webiste incase the website has more than one ipaddress 
 , you must dency access to each of the website by writing each iptables rules 

NOTE: IP TABLES USES IPADRESS AND NOT DOMAIN nameofthewebstite
       NOT BLOCKIGN BIG APPLICATION WEBSITE LIKF GOOGLE OR FACEBOOK IS WRONG TO DO SO , USING SPPLICAION LIKE SQUID IS THE BEST WAY TO BLOCK THOSE WEBSITTES


note: if you see 0.0.0.0/0 means any ip address with any subnetmask
