filter by tcp or udp pirt 

                         MATCH BY A SINGLE PORT 
match option : -p tcp --dport portnumberhere 
               -p udp --srport portnumberhere

examples:

iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport -j DROP 

                  MATCH BY MULTIPLE PORTS 
match option : -m multiport --sports | --dports port1, port2 

example:
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m multiport --dports 80, 443 -j ACCEPT 



  note: ICMP do not user ports at all     

                                     PORTS STATES
FILTERED PORT: A filtered pprt is infact an open port but there is a firewall that is dropping the packets 
CLOSED PORT: is a port on whic no application is listening , which means we ereciev a tcp packet with the reste flag set 

                            ALLOWING ONLY A SINGLE MACHINE T CONNECT 

For example, you want a single machine or ipaddress to connect to the server and rpevent the rest people from connecting to the server;the following can be done 

to do this the followiung steps can be done
1. flush the iptables
2. place the ipaddres you want to accept only aftee flushig 
3. note: if the defeault policy is set to drop you do not meed to state any rule because it will drop all packets except the rule stated in number 
       but ifs default  policy is set to accept , you will need to create the rule to drip the other ipaddress 

       for example


iptables -F 

###create only the source ipaddress

iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -s sourceipaddress -j ACCEPT 
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -J DROP ( and you can still specify the sourc -s 0/0 but it is not Mandatory)
