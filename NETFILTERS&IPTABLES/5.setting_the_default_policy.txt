policy specifies what happens to packets that are not matched against any rule.
by default policy is set accept all traffic
policy can be changed only for INPUT, OUTPUT and FORWARD chains
policy can be changed using -P option 

traffice filtering is done in the filtering table ,


if a packet passes all rules in the table from top to bottom without being matched against any rule then default policy is applied and maybe set to either accept or drop 

when organizing firewall we should have the following options in mind:
1. we can set the default policy to drop all packets and only allow rules to be matched to specifc sources that are trusted
2. we can set the default policy to accept all packets and set rules to specifically drop or deny packets from plcaes that are not trusted

NOTE: THE FIRST OPTIONS IS USED AND IT IS CONSIDERED MORE SECURE AND ITS USED FOR THE INPUT CHAIN , by default policy is set to accept 
all packets except otherwise stated to drop any packets and rules 


checking the policy 

iptables -vnl

when thiscommand is run by the side of the policy which is stated for example 

chain ouput (policy accpts 0 packets , 0 bytes)

if you see accept it means that the default policy is set to accept


settig the default policy todrop packets 

lets say we are tryign to drop all packets cominf into the networj 

iptables -P INPUT DROP 

NOTE:  setting the DROP policy ON AN INPUT CHAIN without any rule that accept traffic is like disconnecting the machine from the network 

NOTE: ALways note that policy should be end of the firewall table , always ensue you create rules that accept traffice bfrore srtting the default policy in the itpabels
