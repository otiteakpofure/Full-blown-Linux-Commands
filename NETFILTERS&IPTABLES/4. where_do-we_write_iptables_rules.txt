it is wise to run all the iprules in a script 
NOTE: iptables do not save rules that are written on the terminal because once the system is shutdown , the rules are gone 

to run a script for firewll rules to appy consistently 
create a shell script and make it bootabele at boot time 

NOTE: WHEN YOU STATE YOUR FIREWALLS AND WHEN YOU RUN THE SCRIPT, MUILIPLTE TIMES THE FIREWALL RULE WILL INCREASE, FOR EXAMPLE '
YOU STATED 3 RULES BUT WHEN YIU RAN THE SCRIPT IT BECAOME 6 AND RUN IT AGAIN IT BECMAE 9, TO ENSURE THIS DOESN HAPPEN USE - f command 
so in the script what you should do is first add 

iptables -F before adding any more rules 




                                 writing rules to change from private address to public address 
iptable -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s theipadressesthatwillbrtranslated  -o outgoinginterfacewhichistheinterfacethattheprivateipaddresswillbechangedfrom -j SNAT --to-source publiciddressonthis
