it is possible to filter traffic only by source mac address 
NOTE: YOU can filter traffic only through source mac address and not the destination mac addreses 

match: -m mac --mac-source place source mac address here 

Example
iptables -A INPUT -i nameoftheinterface -m mac --mac-source place source mac address here -j DROP 

NOTE: mac address are only valid inside the local area network 
      this is not a strong security protocol because it can be spoofed 


                                 uses cases for mac addresses 
1. drop packets from a specific mac address 
2. permit only a list of trusted hosts (macs) through the firewall router 


NOTE: REMEMBER MAC ADDDRESS BELONGS TO LAYER 2 AND AS MUCH if the packet is dropped other things are also dripped as well  

to add a list of trusted mac addresses and remove mac addresses from the ones that are not stated in the fiule 

1. create the script 
2. flush 
3. add a list of permitted mac addresses
4. set the policy in the forward table to drop so that other addrsses are nit accepte 


#!/bin/bash 

iptables -F FORWARD 

PERMITTED_MACS ="place the list of mac addresses here"

for MAC in $permitted_macs
do 

   iptables -A FORWARD -m mac --mac-source $MAC -j ACCEPT 
done 

iptables - P FORWARD DROP
