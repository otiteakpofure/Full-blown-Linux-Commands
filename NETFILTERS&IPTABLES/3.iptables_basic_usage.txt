IPtables is used to configure netfilter 
ensure that when writing iptable rules , ensure evertyhign is correct 

before strating writing rules and run the iptables command 

 RULES FOR IPtables

 1. to check the tabales for input, outpout and forward chains use - iptables -L
 2.  to check rules from othertablles use = iptables -t (thenameofthetable) -l  tables includes  netfilter(dfeault), nat, mangle and raw 
 



  TABLES       
   filter
   nat 
   mangle 
   raw  

   COMMAND 
   -a (appeND) - Append the rule to the end of the selcted chain
   -i (INSERT) - insert one or more rules in the selected chain on a specific position by default on top 
   -D(DELETE)  - list all rules in the selected chain . if no chain is slected all chains are listed 
   -R(REPLACE) - list all rules in the selected chain . if no chain is slected all chains are listed 
   -F(FLUSH)  - flush the selcted chain ( all chains in the table if  none is given)
   -Z(ZERO)   - zero the packet and byte counters in all chains , or only the given chain
   -L(LIST)   -
   -S(SHOW)
   -N    - create a new user-defined chaing by the given name  
   -X  - delete the user define specifid chain 
   -P - set the policy for the built-in chain (INOUT, output and forward)


NOTE: ALL THESE ARE WRITTEN IN CAPITAL LETTERS AND MUST BE ONE AT TIME ON A GIVEN RULES EXCEPT OTHERWISE STATED 


   CHAIN 

-input , -output , -forward , -prerouting , -postrouting , - user-defined 


   MATCHES

  ADDING RULES TO THE IPTABLES TO DROP INCOMING PACKETS 
  To do this: iptables -t nameofthetableyouwanttodroppackets -A INPUT -P(which states the protocol) place protocoal here  -J 
  so to drop incoming packets on the netfiler tables

                               iptables -t filter -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j DROP 

NOTE: this command can be run without the -t filter option , this is only necessary when the table is not filter 

LISTING CONNTES OF THE FIREWALL 
this shows you rules associated with iptables 

IPTABLES -L OR IPTABLES -VNL
NOTE: when this command is run , there is number shown under it and it states the number of packets whuch are matched by the rule 


                              DENYING A MACHINE ACCESS TO ANOTHER MACHINE OR WEBSITE 
In doing this serveral things have to be considered for example ,  
1. what kind of table are you going to use whether filter or nat 
2. what kind of command are you using 
which destination port and protocol and what website will be blocked  

so for example blockingaccess to  a particular website 
    iptables -t nameofthetable -A command to runing since its going outside -p typeof protocoll dport portnumber -d destinationwebsite -j(means jump to the specific target) DROP 
    NOTE : TARGET AND COMMAND are always written in uppercase letters  

    iptables -t filter -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -d www.ubuntu.com -j DROP
     iptables -t filter -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -d www.ubuntu.com -j DROP

                                  USING -A COMMAND 

                     APPENDING A RULE TO THE OUTPUT CHAIN THAT DROPS INCOMING PACKET 

NOTE: -A ADD RULES TO THE END OF THE IPTABLE CHAIN , SO THE RULE GOES TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CHAIN 


iptables -t filter -A input -p tcp --dport 25 -j DROP 

this drops incoming packets coming in throught port 25 


    note: when a port is filtered after running nmap it shows the packets has been dropped  by the firewall


        BLOCKING INCOMONG TRAFFIC TO PORT 80 
    iptables -t filter -A input -p tcp --dport 80 -J DROP 


                                  USING -I COMMAND 

    NOTE : IT INSERTS RULES INTO A PARTICULAR POSITION IF NO POSITION IS GIVEN

WHAT THIS MEANS THAT WHEN YIU STATE A FIREWALL RULE , THIS RULE WILL BE ADDED TO THE FRIST POSTION WHEN THE FIREWALL IPTALES -VNL COMMAND IS LISTED 

FOR example dropping packets coming to port 69 iptables 

iptables -t filter -I input -p udp --dport 69 -J DROP

this command will be first command shown in the iptables chain '



 NOTE: ENSURE WHEN SETTING RULES IMPORTATN RULES STAY AT THE TOP BECAUSE RULES ARE TRAVERSED FROM TOP TO BOTTOM 

                                        ADDING RULES TO SPECIFIC POSITION 

To specify a rule at a specific position 

for example . you want to put a rule on the 3rd position 

iptables -t filter -I input 3 -p udp --dport 69 -J DROP

this will show the rule in the 3rd position 

                                             ALLOWING TRAFFIC TO A PARTICULAR PORT
For example , you want to acceopt a traffic to a particular port  the following can be done:
  ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS USED ACCEPT AT THE END OF THE CHAIN 


                      iptables -t filter -I input 3 -p udp --dport 69 -J ACCEPT


                     using -L 

list all rules on the specifed tables 

iptables -l = list all rules and list all its chains 
         -n = numberic 
         -v = verbose 

                            -f 
means to flush all chains or slected chains  = to deleting all the rules 

for example flushing the inout chaing =  iptables -F INPUT 
NOTE: if the input or output is not specified the input flush will flush input ,output and forwarding as well


FLUSHING ALL CHAINS OF NAT TABLE WHICH IS A TYPE OF FIREWALL  IPTABLES -T nat -F 


                                  -z 
which means zero the packet in the byte counter in all the chains or only in the given chain 


for examples after staying variouis iptables chains and then running the iptables -vnl yoi see a list of pkts and byte

fpr example after running the below command 

iptables -t filter -I input 3 -p udp --dport 69 -J DROP

when this command is done runnijg , there are pkts and bytle associtied with it , to clear out or remove the pkts and byte , run the 

                                                              iptables - z command 
this will clear the pkts and byte associated with the iptables rules 


                                          -N 
creates news user defined chanin
for examples , 

what this means is that when -N is used it used to created a chain for a specific user 
for example , you can run the following command

                             iptables -N nameoftheuser (lets say the user is jon)#

                             iptables -N jon 

when the iptables -vnl cvommand is run , it will show all the iptables rules associated with jon and oithers

                                  - x 
this command is used to delete a chain, for example 
            iptables -X andthenameoftheuser 


                           -P 
set the defeault policy for the built in chain input ,output and forward. the default policy specifies what happens to packets that are not matched, by any rule and can either be ACCEPT OR dropped 

the default policy is set to ACCEPT

                                      CHANGING THE DEFAULT POLICY 

for example changing the policy for forward, that is dropping all packets for forward

  iptables -P forward drop 

  this means each packet not accepted by a rule will,be dropped 


      -d 
NOTE: IT IS NOT ADVISABLE TO DELETE A RULE , RATHER CREATE A SCRIPTWHERE ALL THE RULES ARE RUNNING AND JUST MODIFY THE SCRIPT 
BUT ESSENTIALLY TO DELETE, THIS INCLUDES 

                      TO DELTE SPECIY THE LINE NUMBER YOU WANT TO DELETE 
TO DO THIS RUN THE IPTABLES -L 

note: the iptables does not show number so you have to count manually , 

                      iptables -D output 2
