                        creating a stateful firewall

1/. 1. create a bash script that contains all iptablees rules 
2. 2. allow loopback traffic on inoput and output chains 
3.   
NOTE: IT IS A GOOD IDEAD TO DROP INVALID PACKETS ON INPUT AND OUTPUT CHAINS 
       THIS KIND OF FIREWALL IS GOOD FOR A DESKTOP OPERATING SYSTEM AS NO ONE CONNECTS TO THEM FROM THE OUTSIDE ONLY INTERNALLY . THE HOST COMMUNICTIONS TO ANY Destination
       WHICH MEANS ALL OUTGOIG TRAFFIC IS PERMITTED BUT ANY INCOMIND TRAFFIC IS REMOVED 

SO TO WRITE A STATEFUL FIREWALL, 

Iptables -F 
NOTE: for example , you want to allow a specfic ip address to ensure it enters a system , place that ip address at the beginning of  the script 

iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT 
iptables -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT 
lo means loopback

##to allow thr given ip address 
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m state  --state NEW -S statetheipaddresshere -j ACCEPT

iptables -A INPUT -m state --state INVALID -j DROP 
iptables -A OUTPUT -o state --state INVALID -j DROP

iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED , RELATED -j ACCEPT 
iptables -A OUTPUT -o state --state NEW, ESTABLISHED, RELATED -J ACCEPT 

iptables -P INPUT DROP 
iptables -P OUTPUT DROP
