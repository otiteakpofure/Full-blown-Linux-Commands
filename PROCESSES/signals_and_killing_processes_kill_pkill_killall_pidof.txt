 Sometimes there are applications which are unresponsive or consume too much space  and inorder to ensure that the OS remains well
 the kill command is used 

 NOTE : TO kill  A PROCESS OR PID THE PROGRAM MUST BE RUNNING 

                                    KILL 
 kill send a signal to a process or a group of processes to stop the process 

 NOTE: when the signal is not specified it defaults to 15 or SIGTERM 

  GET A LIST OF ALL LIST OF KILL COMMANDS (kill -l )
               This shows the list of kill commands available 

kill -l 

it will list about 64 processes 


NOTE:  each signal is identified by  a number or name . A signal is notification sent to  a processe to tell the process how to be behave 

                                              HOW TO SEND A SIGNAL TO A PROCESS

There are 3 ways to kill a process and they are explained below :

                                                            1
 The first step in sending a signal to a process . for example the gedit program is running on the foreground and you want to send
 a signal to it. to do it a signal will need to be sent 

                                    pgrep -l gedit 
this will list the the PID number running and the number of the process 
gedit has a process number of 14804 

   so to send a signal to the process the following can be done : for example i want to send a SIGINT process to the gedit 
   i will do the following 
                                     kill -2  14804  = kill - signalnumber PID 


                                                        2
                                        PIDOF COMMAND 
The pidof command helps to get the PID of the process . for example you want to get the pid of firefox, the following
command will be run 
                                       pidof firefox 
This will print all processes and firefox has more than one process and please note any program can have more than one process
as far all are running on the foreground and to kill all of them , the following command will be used 

                                   for example killing all firefox process assuming it has 4 processes 
                                   kill -2 (list the number of process id ) or kill - INT (number of process id)

NOTE: The signal name must be in CAPITAL LETTERS

                                                       3
To kill a process you can also do the following command . Imagine you want to kill firefox 4 processes again, the following command will becan be run 

                                 kill - SIGINT $(pidof firefox)
NOTE: SIGINT (SIGNAL INTERUPTION) is a part of the process which is shown when the kill -l command is run 


NOTE: Non -provilege user can send signal to their processes while root can send signal to all processes 

                                              RELOADING SIGNAL ( )
                                              
NOTE: A SERVER READS ITS CONFIGIGURATION ONLY AT START-UP SO YOU MUST RELOAD IT EACH POINT A CONFIGURATION IS MADE
