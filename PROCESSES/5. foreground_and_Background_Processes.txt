They are basicalluy two types of services which are foreground and background processes


                                       FOREGROUND PROCESS 
Foreground processes are started by the user and while they are running the user cannot start any processes in theterminal.it gets 
its input from the keboard and shows the output on the screen 

                                          BACKRGOUND PROCESS 
Background processes are started by the system process . while they are running you can running in the background process.
to start a the background process you must add & at the end of the command.  




foreground processes AND background processes 

EXPLANATION: you open a terminal, and then run a command as far the command does not have & at the end of the command
it is a foreground process but if it has & at the end of the command it is background process and it does not 
need to wait before you run another command in the terminal . this means that foreground process allows command to 
run only when it is finished.  

                                            /dev/null = called the null device or black hole because it discards anything sent to it

The /dev/null is a directory in which processes output that you dont want to show on the screen can be sent 


                              STARTING A PROCESS IN FOREGROUND USING A DEBUG mode


You can start a program in deubg mode by running the program and using the -n command . for example you want to start proFTPD, you can run this by 

                                                   ./proftpd -n
