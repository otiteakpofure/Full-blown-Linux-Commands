nmap = network mapper 

security audting tool used by many admiinistrators its is a complex appliction 

NMAP can perform variety of scans which includes the following:
a. TCP Scans:
     SYN scan: -sS (root only)
     connect scan: -sT  (DOEs not require root prvivilege)

UDP Scans:-sU 
ICMP SCAN: -sn or -sP 


                                LSOF = LIST FILES THAT ARE OPEN BY ANY PROCESS IN THE SYSTEM 

IT CAN SCAN THOURSANDS OF PORTS WITHIN SECONDS IF NO FIREWALL RESTRCITS THE SCAN , IT CAN ALSO BE CALLED HALF OPEN SCANNING BECAUSE IT DOES NOT PERFORMSA FULL TCP CONNECTION

                                             default tcp 

nmap andtheipaddress 

NOTE: BY default nmap scans 1000 ports , so its smart you change all wellknown ports to other ports 

for example, i change ssh to port 50000 since nmap scans the first 1000 ports and well known ports so to check such ports you have use p 


                                               SCANNING MULTIPLE PORTS 

To scan multiple ports , use the following command: 

 nmap listtheportsusing ,,,, and ipaddress , lets say we want to scan 22,80,443, so we do the following 

                         nmap  22,80,443 ipaddrress
