                                              ARP SCANNING 

Allows for scanning of the localarea network . arp scanning is useful when there are host on the network who wish to remain hidden or stealthy 
and do not respond to any requests like ping, tcp or upd scans. 
there are alot of firewalls which block incoming packets except arp , arp is not routable 


                                      arp scan 
1. To chaeck if arp is installed run , arp-scan and can install it using apt install arp-scan
2. 


                          to scan the entire network while generating addressees use the command below 
arp-scan -I thenamoftheinterface -l 

I = means interface 
L = localnetwork

note: ARP SCAN IS VERy noisy and as such IDPS/ system administrator can find out information

                                                NETDISCOVER 

Netdiscover is like an arp scan although ot is more stealthier and quieter than the arp scan;

it is both an active and passive arp recornissiance tool

first install netdiscover,  


                                     to start an arp scan

run the command netdiscover . NOTE: THIS IS THE ACTIVE MODE , WHERE NETDISCOVER IS SENDING ARP SCAN TO FIND OIUT MORE HOST ON THE NETWORK 


note: yiu havr to stop it by pressing q or ctrl +c 



                                    SCANNING INTERFACE USING NETDISCOVER 
TO SCAN A PARTIUCLAR INTterface, run the command 

                                    netdiscover -i andthenameoftheinterface 

NOTE: IF THR INTERFACE IS NOT STATED, THE SCAN USED THE AVAILABLE ONE INTERFACE


                               USING -R 

this sends arp scan in a given range , for example ,    netdiscover -i andthenameoftheinterface  -r ipaddressanditsubnet (192.168.0.4/24)



                                     running nerdiscver in passive command 

    netdiscover -p 

    NOTE: IN THIS MODE , IT DOESNT NOT SEND ANY ARP REQUEST OR SEND ANY SIGNALES , IT ONLY SNIFFS THE TRAFFIC 

    IT IS MANDARORY TO ALSO CHANGE YOUR MAC ADDRESS BEFORE LAUNCHING A PASSIVE SCAN
