nmap = network mapper 

security audting tool used by many admiinistrators its is a complex appliction 

NMAP can perform variety of scans which includes the following:
a. TCP Scans:
     SYN scan: -sS (root only)
     connect scan: -sT  (DOEs not require root prvivilege)

UDP Scans:-sU 
ICMP SCAN: -sn or -sP 


                                LSOF = LIST FILES THAT ARE OPEN BY ANY PROCESS IN THE SYSTEM 

IT CAN SCAN THOURSANDS OF PORTS WITHIN SECONDS IF NO FIREWALL RESTRCITS THE SCAN , IT CAN ALSO BE CALLED HALF OPEN SCANNING BECAUSE IT DOES NOT PERFORMSA FULL TCP CONNECTION

                                             default tcp 

nmap andtheipaddress 

NOTE: BY default nmap scans 1000 ports , so its smart you change all wellknown ports to other ports 

for example, i change ssh to port 50000 since nmap scans the first 1000 ports and well known ports so to check such ports you have use p 


                                               SCANNING MULTIPLE PORTS 

To scan multiple ports , use the following command: 

 nmap listtheportsusing ,,,, and ipaddress , lets say we want to scan 22,80,443, so we do the following 

                         nmap  22,80,443 ipaddrress


                                                   scanning all ports
    to scan all ports , we do the following:

    nmap -p- ipaddress


    NOTE: This can take a really long time and if you press the enter key it will tell you hiw many percent has gine 



    PERFORMING A UDP SCAN 

    NMAP -su ipaddress 

    PERFORMING AN ICMP SCAN 

    nmap -sn or -sP  ipaddress 

                                   scanning ports wothoit probing 

for example , a port seems down when it writes the host seem down , for example port 80,443 to scan that port afte the pport seems down ,

do the following command 

 nmap -p wirtteportnumber ipaddress -PO 

 -PO = sendin sanning without probing
