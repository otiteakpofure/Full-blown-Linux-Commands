it is compatable with wireshark , and its a command line tool 

                           CHECKING THE NETWORK INTERFACE

to checks what network is coming to a particular interface 
tcpdump -i nameoftheinterface 

you can check the interface by running ifconfig 

SO AFTER DOING THIS , YOU CAN CHECK THE CAPTURED PACKETS ON THE INTERFACE, 
                                                   TO and from SEE PACKET FROM AN ipaddress
For example , you want to check packets coming from an specific ipadress to yoyr hosrt machine

             lets say traffic coming from google to you 

                      tcpdump-i nameoftheinterface host ipaddress here 

                      tcpdump-i nameoftheinterface host google.com

                                     to see traffice coming from either src or dst do the following
tcpdump-i nameoftheinterface dst theipaddress -n   -n = means that the dns server will cimvert either the ipadrreess to numbers 

                                     to see traffic comming or going to a specific port 

to see traffic coming or going to a specific port do the following:

  tcmpdump -i nameoftheinterface dts port placeportnumber -vv -n 

                                                  CAPTURE PACKEET GOING TO OR FROM A PARTICULAR SUBNET 

tcpdump-i nameoftheinterface net thesubnetaddress 


                                                                       SEEING PACKETS FROM A PARTICULAR applications
To see packets coming froma particular application/ port number 

                        tcpdume-i nameoftheinterface port placeportnumberhere -vv -n 

so lets say its coming from   https port number 443 

so it goes like this 

                                                
  tcpdump-i nameoftheinterface port 443 -vv -n 

                             to see the ascii string add the -A option

                              tcpdume-i nameoftheinterface port 443 -vv -n  -A 

                              NOTE: TO USE BOTH ASCCII AND HEXADECIMAL DATA  CHANGE -A TO -X 

                                  moving packet captured data to a file 

it is often useful to move captured packet data to a file:
                                       TO MOVE CAPTRUED DATA TO A FILE USUALLY CALLED PCAP FILES DO THE FOLLOWING;

FOR EXAMPLE SAVING HTTP PACKETS TO AFILE 

                   TCPDUMP -I nameoftheinterface port 80 -W NAMEOFTHEFILE.PCAP 

                   TO READ THE FILE AFTER CAPTURING 

                   TCPDUMP -R NAMEOFTHEFILE 
note: when reading the file yo can still run other commands on it , which means when the file is open from reading 

you can run command like this  tcpdume-i nameoftheinterface port placeportnumberhere -vv -n  and any other commands it will sitll work 


                             USING LOGICAL AND OR OR OPERATORS 
FOR EXAMPLE TO SEE AN ACTION COMING FROM A PARTICULAR HOST , LETS SAY YOU WANT TO SEE ICMP PACKETS COMING FROM A HOST 

TCPDUMP -I THENAMEOFTHEINTERFACE ICMP AND HOST THENAMEOFTHEHOSTIPADRESS 

NOTE: IT WILL CAPTURE ICMP PACKETS TO AND FROM THE ADRESS 
SO FOR EXAMPLE CAPTURING ICMP FROM GOOGLE.COM

                       TCPDUMP -I THENAMEOFTHEINTERFACE ICMP AND HOST GOOGLE.COM
