                        CHOWN AND CHGRP
In linux all files are associated with owner and group 
the chown and chgrp commands are used to change the files owner and group




NOTE: The root can change ownership 

                             CHOWN COMMAND
To change ownership of a file or directory  run the chown command 


to run this write the chown (the new owner ) (the file name)



if you want to do it for more tha one file , run thesame command then apepen the files to them 
for example, yoi have file 1.txt, 2.txt and 3.txt . to change ownership of these file do

                 chown (the new owner)  1.txt 2.txt 3.txt


NOTE: you can use the user ID found in the passwd file to change the ownership

FOR Example if there is a username called 1005 and the ID is 1005  , and you run the chown command the ownership wlli
be transfered to the username , to avoid this error, the following should be done 


                                         sudo chown +1005 (the name of the file you want to change)


NOTE: The chown command can change both the owner and group of the file you want to change


                 to change both ownership and group at the sametime do the following 
                                    chown the new ownername : the new group name  (the file you want to change)
                                    chown new owner:new group word.txt 

NOTE : ON SOME linux distributions the . command is used instead of the : command 

                                               CHGRP 
                        TO CHANGE ONLY THE GROUP OF THE FILE AND NOT THE OWNER 
                 
     CHGRP (THE NAME OF THE GROUP ) FILE NAME 

to change all the ownership and files in a given directory run the command 

    sudo chown -R name of the new onwer : name of the new group ~
