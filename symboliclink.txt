softlink or symbolic link or softlink

to crate a symlink or symbolic link use the command 


ln -s (the name of the file you want to create an symboliuc for) ( the new name of the file you want to create)

lets say we want to create a symbolic link for the etc/passwd files after creaton it will look like this:
                                                  pswd -> /etc/passwd

                                TO DISPLAY RUNNING PROCESSES 

                                ps -aux 
NOTE : The difference between hardlink and symbolic link is that if you change directory of a file that an hardlink was created for 
it wont be broken but if you use a symbolic link it will be broke 

ffor example you create an hardlink for the file name man.txt if you move it to another directory it wont be broke 
but if you use a symbolic link it will be broken 

 when a symlink is broke it will have red and black color
