APT = Advanced package tool 
The recommended way to manage package on ubuntu and debains based distributions using APT 

NOTE: From the latest linux distributions , there is no need to use APt-get or apt-cache just use apt whicch combines all functions 

unlike dpkg, apt does not understand deb files, it calls the dpkg repository in which all files are downloaded from a repository

An APT repository is collection of APT services, 


A special kind of repository hosted on servers are laucnhpad which are PPA (personal package archivees) which are maintained by people who are not ubuntu developers
