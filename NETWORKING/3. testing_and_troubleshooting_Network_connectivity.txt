The most utility for testing network connectivity is ping 

echo request = is when you send a ping request
echo reply or response = is when the ping address respondes back to you 

 PING 
 PING by default does reverse dns look ups , an ipaddress can be set to multiple domaain names 

 prevvnting ping from doing reverese dns look ups  =  ping -n  what this does it instead of the ping showing the domain name and the ip address
 it only shows the ip address 

  exaplain the ping command 

bytes = size of the packet 
icmp_seq = the sequence of the packets  NOTE : WHEN THE icmp_seq number is not correct know the packets follows different route 
ttl =  this is number of hops between sources and destination which are usually routers 
time =  round trip needed for packets to go and return 

                                               time
a round trip time below 30 is excellent 
30 -50  = average 
50 - 100 = some how slow 
>100 = really slow that does not allow voip 

                                                     PING -i

By default ping waits one second before sending a packet , to stop the ping for waiting do the followijg 

 ping -i  (number of seconds less tha 1)

 Note: this allowed only for privilege users 


                                                     GETTING SUMMARY OF THE PING 


                                                     PING -Q


NOTE: YOU CAN DISOVER PATH A PACKET TAKE BY SEDNING PINGS . IF A ROUTER RECEIVES A TTL OF 1 IT WILL DISCARD THE PACKET AND TELL THE SOURCE (TIME EXCEEDED)
using ttl as 1 is the first router towards the desination 
                      to know the first ttl do the following command = ping -t 1 -c  3 -n (ip address)

                         t = ttl and which are equals to the router by changing this number you can discover the routers from source to desintation 



                                           EASY AND QUICK WAY TO TROUBLE SHOOT CONNECTIVITY ISSUES 
                                           1. PING GATWAY 
                                           2. PING A PUBLICM IP ADDRESS ( 8.8.8.8. OR 1.1.1.1.)
                                           3. PING AN OPEN DNS SERVER SUCH AS GOOGLE.coM
