The most utility for testing network connectivity is ping 

echo request = is when you send a ping request
echo reply or response = is when the ping address respondes back to you 

 PING 
 PING by default does reverse dns look ups , an ipaddress can be set to multiple domaain names 

 prevvnting ping from doing reverese dns look ups  =  ping -n  what this does it instead of the ping showing the domain name and the ip address
 it only shows the ip address 

  exaplain the ping command 

bytes = size of the packet 
icmp_seq = the sequence of the packets  NOTE : WHEN THE icmp_seq number is not correct know the packets follows different route 
ttl =  this is number of hops between sources and destination
time =  round trip needed for packets to go and return 

                                               time
a round trip time below 30 is excellent 
30 -50  = average 
50 - 100 = some how slow 
>100 = really slow that does not allow voip 

                                                     PING -i

By default ping waits one second before sending a packet , to stop the ping for waiting do the followijg 

 ping -i  (number of seconds less tha 1)

 Note: this allowed only for privilege users 


                                                     GETTING SUMMARY OF THE PING 


                                                     PING -Q
