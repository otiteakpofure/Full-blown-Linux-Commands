setting up static interfaces 

since the introduction of latest network configuration tools , netplan has become the default configiration model for network interfaces
It uses yaml files which are located in /etc/netplan/

NETPLAN 
to render back end interfaces , network manager , systemd , networkd on ubuntu based services 

1.  NETWORK MANAGER : is mostly used on desktop based machines 
2. system d and  networkd =  on servers without gui 

                                             SETTING UP A STATIC IP ADDRESS USING NETPLAN 
UBUNTU DESKTOP 

 To set up Ip address on ubuntu desktop click on the right hand side with the icon pointing down ad choose wired settings 
 and click setting or go to ipv4 or ipv6 and choose manual then set it up statically 


                                             CONFIGURING THE NETWORK INTERFACE ON A SERVER WITH NO GUI USING SYSTEMD  & NETWORd
FIRST STEP: Disable the network manager . the network interface is managed using network both the networkD and network maager can manage network interfcae but not by both at the same time 

then stop network manager : systemctl stop NetworkManager
                            systemctl disable NetworkManager ( this disable the network manager)

TO CHECK IF A SERVICE WILL START AT BOOT TIME :
                             SYSTEMCTL IS-ENABLED (NAME OF SERVICE) IN THIS CASE NETWORK MANAGER 

note: if the command out is (disabled) it means it wont start at boot time

                                             THE NEXT STEP IS TO CREATE A YAML FILE 

IF YOU DONT USE THE NETWORK MANAGER ANYMORE , ITS BETTER YOU REMOVE THE EXISTIING NETPLAN YAML FILE 

 so what you do is open a vim and create a file 

 vim /etc/netplan/config.yaml


                                                   THE CONTENT OF THE NETPLAN FILE 
The netplan file starts with network 
network:
   version: which is the version of the network configuration format
   renderer: networkd
   ethernet: if it is wiredcaeble and wifi: if it is a wireeless cable  and its here you will specific one or more network interfaces
             
when you create this file dhcp is usually set to false but if you want dhcp to dynamically assign ips use dhcp set to true 


after editing the yaml file , to apply the changes then run the 

                                             netplan apply command 

yaml uses two spaces for identation
