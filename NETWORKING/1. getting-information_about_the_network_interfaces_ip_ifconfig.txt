                                              CONFIGURING NETWORK INTERFACES
NOTE: You must  be root to set netwrorks settings
getting needed information about netwrork interfaces 


ifconfig 

part of nettools packages

there is a net alternatives called ip  

NOTE : If ifconfig does not work , it is good to install the net-tools package. 

The command ifconfig and ip can be used to both display aand configure the network interfaces 

                             DISPLAYING A LIST OF ALL IP ADDRESSES AND NETWORK INTERFACES 
To display a list of all network interfces and ip addresses use the 
                                      ifconfig -a  or ip address show  or ip addr show  or ip a 

the difference is that ifconfig  and ip address show displays both enable and disable interfaces 

NOTE:  If you omit the -a option, ifconfig will show only the enabled interfaces 

                                       TO DISPLAY ONLY IPV4 OR IPV6 ADDRESS 
To display on;y ipv4 addresses , run the following command :  

ip -4 address and to display v6 chnage the 4 to 6 

                                        GETTING SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT A NETWORK INTERFACE 
To get specific information about a network interface; run the follwing command 
                                                  ifconfig (the name of the interface)


                                                  DISPLAYING DNS SERVERS 
To display the DNS servers or default gateway run the following command 
                                                   route

                                                   or 

                                                   route- n  ( display all network configiration in the numerical format)
                                                   

                                        HOW TO SET NETWORK INTERFACES


setting interfaces up and down 

to set and interfce down which means to ensure the interfaces is not valid use this command 
                        ifconig (the name of the interface you want) down  or ip link set (the name of the interface you want) down
and after it is down when thre ifconfig is run agaim it wont be displayed.



 to set it up  ifconig (the name of the interface you want) up or ip link set (the name of the interface you want) up

note: configurations set using the ifconfig command are not persistent after a system restart, it looses its configurations

                                                         PARTS OF THE IP CONFIG

ether = is the mac address 
displays packets and byte recieved  = TX packets and byte recieved

                                                  network inteface names
enp0s3= is the ethernet interface 
en = ethernet interface
p = port numbers = port number 0
s= slot number  which is slotnumber3

wl = wireless lan 




                                                       NON-STATIC CONFIGURATION OF IP ADDRESSES 
IP addresses can be configured using the ifconfig command but these configuration are not persistent. to add a new ip address to an interface
you can do : ifconfig (the name of the interface you want) ipaddress/subnetmask up
for example you want to configure enp0s3 196.145.0.111/24 
                    ifconfig enp0s3 196.145.0.111/24  up
then run ifconfig after

                                                    REMOVING AN IP ADDRESS FROM AN INTERFACE 
To remove an ip address from an interface , you do the following : 
                                                         ip address del (ipaddress/subnetmask) dev (interface name)

                                                          ADDING AN IP ADDRESS FROM AN INTERFACE 
To add an ip address to an interface you can use 
                                                 ip address del (ipaddress/subnetmask) dev (interface name)

                                                 ENSUING  PERSISTENCE/STATIC CONFIGURATION OF NETWORK INTERFACES 
On ubuntu the netplan can be used to make static configuration to network interfaces,
