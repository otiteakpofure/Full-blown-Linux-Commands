grep searches for patters in a text file

NOTE : GREP WORKS IN FILE 

 to search for a patter in a string  and numbers

 grep (the name of the string) and file path = whic displayed all the string with opatter 

PLEASE NOTE : if the string has spaces between use " " 

so grep "the string with spaces between" and the name of the file 

                          for casinsenstivie 

                          grep -i the string and file 

PRINT THE LINE NUMNERS 

GREP -N THE STRING AND NME OF FILE 

                                                 TO SEARCH FOR WHOLEWORDS 
Like for example man 

grep -w man (path to the file)

                                                TO SEARCH FOR LINES WHICH DO NOT CONTAIN A PARTICULAR STRING 
If you want to search for lines which do not contain a particular string do this for example searching for man 

  grep -v man (path to the file) = it will print files which does not contain a particular string which is man in this casinsenstivie



                              SEARCHING FOR  A STRING IN A BINARY FILE 
            grep -a the name of the string then the path to the file 


                                                SEARCH FOR A PATTERN IN A DIRECTORY  AND SUB DIRECTORY
To search a directory and its subdirectories use the -R command 

   grep -R (the name of the string) path to directory


 when searching for a pattern and then to remove errors such permission denied or no such file or directory use -s command 

                      grep -R (the name of the string) path to directory -s


              CHECKING FOR THE NUMBER OF MATCHES
To check for the  number of matches in a file use the - c command 

 grep -c (the name of the string) path to the file   = it will display the number of matches
please note: this is small letter c

  KERNEL RING BUFFER

  dmesg = log file for the kernel

                                                TO PRINT LINES BEFORE AND AFTER MATCHES

TO PREVENT LINES BEFORE MATCHES USE -B 
TO print lines after matches use -A 

 grep man -A 3 B-4 path to the file = it will display the  3 lines after the match and 4 lines before the match . you can use any number yo want

             or 

alternatively you can use the capital C to do it for example you want to print 3 lines before the match and 3 lines after the match 

  grep -C 3 error path to the file 

                          you can use any number you want 



                                  NETSTAT
To show programs running in a specific port you can use netstat command 

 for example in using netstat to check for a particular port 

  netstat -tupan | grep 53 




       using regex expressio in grep 

       ^ = beginning of lines
       $ = end of line

       to remove empty spaces use grep -v "^$"

                                       sorting by alphabetcia
sort - r  NOTE: without r it will still sort the file but by name in alphabetical order 

                                                   SEARCHING FOR STRINGS IN BINARY FILES 

What are binary files 

binary files are exectuable files to print characters from the binary file   use the string command

                                                    The strings command will print prinatable characrters from binary files 

strings are used to print ascii characters from hinary files or rather print printable chareacters someone can read 


                                                     COMPARING FILES CONTENTS  binary or not

                                                     using cmp
You can produce the output of a command into another file 

this is different from pipe 
                  ifconfig > a = it will print the statisitcs of ifconfig and create a file called a 
if you want to compare files use the cmp command 
for example there are 2 files called a and b = to compare both of them use cmp a b it will print the output 

                                           using sha256 
sha256sum and path to the 1st file path to the second file 

                                                USING THE DIFF 
    NOTE: THE dIFF COMMAND IS USED ONLY FOR TEXT FILES 

DIFF pathtothe1st file pathtothesecondfile

diff - B = ignores blannk lines 
diff -W = ignores white spaces
diff -i = ignores casinsenstivie
diff -c = fpr more detailed comparison 
diff -y = shows differences between two lines sides by side in columns 



                              using the PATCH COMMAND 
The patch command helps to show differences between files , the patch will help work similar to the diff but it helps to show changes made in the 
original file and new files
                                    and shows how the file will be similar to the other ones
