 to search for a patter in a string 

 grep (the name of the string) and file path = whic displayed all the string with opatter 

PLEASE NOTE : if the string has spaces between use " " 

so grep "the string with spaces between" and the name of the file 

                          for casinsenstivie 

                          grep -i the string and file 

PRINT THE LINE NUMNERS 

GREP -N THE STRING AND NME OF FILE 

                                                 TO SEARCH FOR WHOLEWORDS 
Like for example man 

grep -w man (path to the file)

                                                TO SEARCH FOR LINES WHICH DO NOT CONTAIN A PARTICULAR STRING 
If you want to search for lines which do not contain a particular string do this for example searching for man 

  grep -v man (path to the file) = it will print files which does not contain a particular string which is man in this casinsenstivie



                              SEARCHING FOR  A STRING IN A BINARY FILE 
            grep -a the name of the string then the path to the file 


                                                SEARCH FOR A PATTERN IN A DIRECTORY  AND SUB DIRECTORY
To search a directory and its subdirectories use the -R command 

   grep -R (the name of the string) path to directory


 when searching for a pattern and then to remove errors such permission denied or no such file or directory use -s command 

                      grep -R (the name of the string) path to directory -s


              CHECKING FOR THE NUMBER OF MATCHES
To check for the  number of matches in a file use the - c command 

 grep -c (the name of the string) path to the file   = it will display the number of matches
please note: this is small letter c

  KERNEL RING BUFFER

  dmesg = log file for the kernel

                                                TO PRINT LINES BEFORE AND AFTER MATCHES

TO PREVENT LINES BEFORE MATCHES USE -B 
TO print lines after matches use -A 

 grep man -A 3 B-4 path to the file = it will display the  3 lines after the match and 4 lines before the match . you can use any number yo want

             or 

alternatively you can use the capital C to do it for example you want to print 3 lines before the match and 3 lines after the match 

  grep -C 3 error path to the file 

                          you can use any number you want 



                                  NETSTAT
To show programs running in a specific port you can use netstat command 

 for example in using netstat to check for a particular port 

  netstat -tupan | grep 53 




       using regex expressio in grep 

       ^ = beginning of lines
       $ = end of line

       to remove empty spaces use grep -v "^$"

                                       sorting by alphabetcia
sort - r  NOTE: without r it will still sort the file but by name in alphabetical order
