LS 
                                          
TO LIST FILES IN A SIGNLE LINE LIKE NUMBERING A PAGE TYPE 
LS -1 = 1 file per line 

ls -l = prints files as well a their permissions and thier groups  and its called a long list 
ls -d = for example , you want to check the /etc/ directory and it has files like maybe man, woman , son and if  you dont want to display its file , the following is done 
                    ls -d = 
this would only list its directories and not its files 


ls -lh = prints the size of the files in human readable format for example if the file size is 4092 ,
it will change it to 4.0K 

  SORTING FILES BY FILE SIZE 
ls -lS  = it sorts the file into size and the largest file comes first 


                
NOTE = S is in capital letters 


SORTING FILES BY EXTENSION ( .LOG ,  .exe )

ls - X


                      IGNORE CERTAIN FILES WHILE LISTING FILES
    ls --hide= *.conf 


                             REAL FILE SIZE
Please note that when you run the  ls command the file size shown with it does not actually display the real and authentic file size
 for example if you want to check the file size of a file for example /etc/

 you run the command =  du -sh (and the name of the directory )   =  du -sh /etc/


                               RECURSIVE LIST 
This command means that even if i list files in the directory , it will also list the subfiles in the directory 
for example a directory called /etc/ which has files called man woman child

if you run the command  >>  ls -lR =  it will list the directory and also list is subfiles 


                                COLOR 
DIRECROTY = BLUE 
FILES= BLACK 
SYMLINK (SYMBOLIC LINK ) = LIGHTBLUE 

DEVICE FILES = YELLOW IN BLACK BACKGROUND 

PLEASE NOTE= By default all these colors come with ls  so if you run the command type ls it will be equals to --alias = auto 
if you do not want to see any changed colors run the \ls
