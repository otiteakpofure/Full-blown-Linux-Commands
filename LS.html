LS 
                                          
TO LIST FILES IN A SIGNLE LINE LIKE NUMBERING A PAGE TYPE 
LS -1 = 1 file per line 

ls -l = prints files as well a their permissions and thier groups  and its called a long list 
ls -d = for example , you want to check the /etc/ directory and it has files like maybe man, woman , son and if  you dont want to display its file , the following is done 
                    ls -d = 
this would only list its directories and not its files 


ls -lh = prints the size of the files in human readable format for example if the file size is 4092 ,
it will change it to 4.0K 

  SORTING FILES BY FILE SIZE 
ls -lS  = it sorts the file into size and the largest file comes first 


                
NOTE = S is in capital letters 


SORTING FILES BY EXTENSION ( .LOG ,  .exe )

ls - X


                      IGNORE CERTAIN FILES WHILE LISTING FILES
    ls --hide= *.conf 


                             REAL FILE SIZE
Please note that when you run the  ls command the file size shown with it does not actually display the real and authentic file size
 for example if you want to check the file size of a file for example /etc/

 you run the command =  du -sh (and the name of the directory )   =  du -sh /etc/


                               RECURSIVE LIST 
This command means that even if i list files in the directory , it will also list the subfiles in the directory 
for example a directory called /etc/ which has files called man woman child

if you run the command  >>  ls -lR =  it will list the directory and also list is subfiles 


                                COLOR 
DIRECROTY = BLUE 
FILES= BLACK 
SYMLINK (SYMBOLIC LINK ) = LIGHTBLUE 

DEVICE FILES = YELLOW IN BLACK BACKGROUND 

PLEASE NOTE= By default all these colors come with ls  so if you run the command type ls it will be equals to --alias = auto 
if you do not want to see any changed colors run the \ls


                                               FILE TIMESTAMPS 
EVEry file on linux have 3 different filestamps 
whicb are in seconds since 1970  

the accesstime stamp  or atime = ls -lu  = last time file was read 
modified timestamp or mtime = ls -l , ls -lt  = last time file contents of the file was changed
changed timestamp or ctime = ls -lc = last time file metadeta about the file was changed like file persmission

                                                   STAT 
run the stat command to show statistics about the file which are its variouis dates 

                                               REAL TIMESTAMPS 
To see the full time stamps and instead of writing ls - lu , ls -lt  ,just run 

                                      ls -l --full-time

                                      NAMING CONVENTIONS FOR FILES 
NOTE : if you are creating files and directories , and you want to put a space between the files use '' for example touch 'my name is the file'

                                                  CHANGGING TIMESTAMPS 
use the touch command to change timestamps in a file if it is already existing, if that file isnt exisiting it will create a new one
 if you wanna change the access time use touch -a ,  and the name of the file 
touch -m  -t= allows you to change the time to a specific time you wish 

                                       TO CHANGE BOTH ACCESS AND MODIFICATION TIMESTAMPS 
USE touch -d 'inside this double quote put the time you want to change'  name of the file

                                                CHANGING THE TIMESTAMPS OF A FILE TO ANOTHER FILE 
Imaging you have two files , linux.txt and ubuntu.txt
 touch linux.txt -r ubuntu.txt
