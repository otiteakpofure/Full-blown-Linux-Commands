RSYNC
snychronizes files between two locations 

it can be used for backups and mirroring  rsync is used for professional backups frequently 

rsync  = is preinstalled in various linux distributioons and when it is installed we do not need applications for backing up 

                                       BASIC EXAMPLE OF RSYNCE 
                    rsync source(oneormorefiles/directories)  desintation(directories)

NOTE : TO USE RSYNC , read permissions must be granted on the source location and write permissions must be granted in the destination location
                                     
                                      COPYING FILES OR BACKING UP FILES BETWEEN TWO locations
                                            RSYNC -AV sourcedirectory  destinationdirectory 

 a= run in archive mode , preserve symlinks, the owner , the group , copy recusrively 

 NOTE: IF THE DESTINATION DIRECTORY DOES NOT EXIST RSYNC WILL CREATE IT 
                                                          SYNCING IN QUIET MODE 

To sync in quiet mode , the rsync can be used appending q to it , this will ensure that no output is shown when copying 
 RSYNC -AQ sourcedirectory  destinationdirectory 
                                                              RSYNC AUTOMATION
Suppose you want to copy files which have been copied before , rsync will know which new file has been added and copy the file instead of copying the whole folder again 

                                                          TO ALLOW DIRECTORIES HAVE THE SAME CONTENTS AT EACH TIME (MIRRORING)
 RSYNC -AV  --DELETE sourcedirectory  destinationdirectory 

                                                              UNDERSTANDING / WHILE COPYING DIRECTORIES 

NOTE: if you are copying directories the / plays a big roles 

NOTE : if you use for example a man directory like this = /man/ = it will copy the contents of the directory but if you use /man = it will copy the directory itself 

                                                          BACKING UP AND EXCLUDINg files
For example , you want to back up files and directories while excluding some files , the following can be done:
                                   let say you have created various files and diretories and you want to exclude some files and directories

            rsync -av --exclude -from = "thepathtothelistoffilesyouwanttoexclude" thesource thedesination

let say you have five files you want to exclude , the best thing to do is to create a file in which the relative path of those files are kept 
in a created file . for example lets say you create the file excludeed.txt so you will place this file which contains excluded files to eb synced from copying

                     rsync -av --exclude -from = "excluded.txt" thesource thedesination 


NOTE : In the excluded files to exclude a directory , used a / after the directory name man/ 



                                              QUICK EXCLUDING OF FILES AND DIRECTORY
If you want to quickly exlucde a diretory , you can qucklydo ths for both files and directories 

   rysnc -av --exclud = "*.txt" source thedesination


                                          EXCLUDING MULTIPLE FILES/DIRECTORIES 
To remove more than one directory or files, you can use the exclude option more than once 
        rysnc -av --exclude = "nameofthedirectory" --exclude ="nameofthedirectory"source thedesination
