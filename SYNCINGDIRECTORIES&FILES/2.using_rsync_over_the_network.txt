using rsync to synchroznize local directories to a remote system 

RSYNC should be first choice 


NOTE: The user who runs the rsync command should have read access to all files innthe location and the derstination should have write access 

                         TO SYNCRHONIZE OVER THE INTERNTET 

To synchroznize over the internet , the use of rsync is necessary as this allows copy files to the remote system

     sudo rsync --av -e ssh (sourcedirectory) usernameoftheremotesystem@ipaddressoftheuserontheremoteystem: destination folder 


                          WANTING DIRECTORIES TO HAVE THE SAME CONTENT
In ensuring that all directories have the same content at each point in time , the following can be done 
  sudo rsync --av -e ssh  -delete (sourcedirectory) usernameoftheremotesystem@ipaddressoftheuserontheremoteystem: destination folder 

                         SPECIFYING AN SSH PORT OTHER THAN THE DEFAULT 22 
To specify another ssh port which is not port 22 can be done like this , so for example if the port is not port 22 bur rather port 2701, do this 

  sudo rsync --av -e "ssh -p 2701" (sourcedirectory) usernameoftheremotesystem@ipaddressoftheuserontheremoteystem: destination folder
