SUID= set user ID 
SGID = Set Group ID 
stick bit = 


                                  THE SUID 

The suid works by interacting with commands . for example when you run cat command on a file that requires sudo command 
you will recieve permission denied but when the SUID is changed , this will allow any user whether privieged or not to 
have access to files and can view and alternate anythuing on the linux system 

NOTE: When an executable fiel with suid is executed the resulting permissions will have the owner of the command and 
not the permmison of the user who executed the command 


                                   to run suid do this 
you do this on command executable files like cat exectuble file , to do this the following should be implemented
                                     in file persmission there are usually 4 digits which is 0000
                                     the first 0 represents the SUID but its very optional thats why it seems its 3 numbers but its four
 

 TO SET SUID BIT ON THE FILE 

  FOR EXAMPLE YOU WANT TO DO THIS ON THE CAT FILE 
              4 reresents the suid 
   sudo chmod 4755 /usr/bin/cat


   and when the ls -l command is run . please note these things 
   1. there is an addition of s which looks like this rws = s here represents the suid   if the s is CAPITAL S then it means there is no executable permissions applied to the file 

   2. the file becomes red in color 


                                    you can alsoset the suid using symbolic mode


                                     sudo chmod ( this can represent either u , g , o) + s (and the name of the file)
