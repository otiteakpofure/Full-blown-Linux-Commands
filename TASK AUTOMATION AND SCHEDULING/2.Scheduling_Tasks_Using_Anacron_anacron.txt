Anacron is similar to cron just that it is used on systems that are up all the time.  It is doesnt not expect to the be run on a system that works
as a server.  if you wana a backrgound job to be executed on a machine that is not up all the time. 

NOTE:CRON runs as a daemon but anacron is just a command , Anacron is run automatically each time the system starts 
so anacron is run by root and the frequencey of its job execution is expressed in days and not in minutes 

                                               LOCATING THE ANACRON EDITOR AND FILE 
1. the file which specifies the anacron jobs is /etc/anacrontab
2. After locating the file ,  /etc/anacrontab when you open this file , there will be 3 jobs which will be related to cron 

NOTE: run-parts is a command which runs all the executable files found in a directory.

3.  there are 4 fields in an anacron job which is found when the file is open 

1           5        cron.daily    run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily
7           10        cron.weekly run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly
@monthly    15         cron.monthly run-parts --report /etc/cron.monthly

they include 1st field = period in days it specifies the job execution in days . for example 1 means run it everyday 7 means every seven days or weekly 
 2nd field = delay in minutes it specifies how long anacron will wait before  excuting the job , the delay feature is intended to keep  the system from being overloaded with loads of job if anacron determine it needs to run several command when things starts up 
             it wont run them simultaneously with a delay 

3rd field = job indentifier , it should be unique for each job , and it is the name of a file that will be created  under /var/spool/anacron
           this is called the job stamp time and it will indicated when the job was executed and it is also done to indeitfy the job and messages in the log file 

4th field = it is the command that will be executed
                                     executing an anacron job 


1           5        cron.daily    run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily
7           10        cron.weekly run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly
@monthly    15         cron.monthly run-parts --report /etc/cron.monthly

after the file is open by deffault there are 2 jobs already stated and they are running , so under the @montly line write the anacron job that you want to execute 

for example 

2      1    backup   date>>tmp/anacron.txt 

                                          SYNTAX ERROR CHECK IN ANACRON 
before running anacron syntax errors can be checked and this is done by running  

                                    anacron -T 

NOTE: IF THERE ARE ANY ERRORS IT WILL PRINT OUT THE ERROR 


                                         TO RUN ANANCRON in the foreground

bY default anacron runs in the backergound but to see the anacron job use the command below to see its output
Run the anacron -d command 

NOTE: Anacron
