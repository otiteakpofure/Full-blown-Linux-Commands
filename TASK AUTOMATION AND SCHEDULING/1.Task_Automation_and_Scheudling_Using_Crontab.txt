cron allows users to perform task at a specific time and it is used to automate repetitive task also known as cron task and runs as a deamon

CRON TAB  = TEXT FILE THAT CONTAINS USERS CRON JOB IS CALLED THE USERS CRON TAB. there is such a file for each users and in ubuntu the files are located in
/var/spool/cron/crontabs 

NOTE: There is a command called crontab used to manag the crontab files and there is also a configuration file for system cronjobs located in /etc/crontab

 TYPES OF cronjobs
 There are two types of cronjobs called 
 a. system wise 
 b. individual user cronjobs 

                                                 individual user cronjobs 
each user has a crontab file which is short for cron table where all scheduled cronjobs of that user are specified . these files are located 
in a subdirectory of /var/spool/cron/

you can edit the crontab file on a text editor but its recommended to edit using crontab command which will open the default editor

                                 TO DISPLAY THE CONTENTS OF THE CRONTAB FILE OF THE CURRENT USER 

RUn this command , crotab -l 

                                 TO EDIT THE CURRENT USER CRONTAB FILE
Run this command crontab -e 

NOTE: YOU WILLK BE PROMPTED WITH SOME EDITORS TO CHOOSE FROM IF NOT EDITOR IS SET 

NOTE:EACH TASK TO RUN SHOULD BE DEFINED BY A SINGLE LINE THAT CONSIST OF 6 FIELDS SEPERATED BY WHITE SPACE 

      THE FIRST FIVE FIELD REPRESENTS WHEN TH TASK WILL BE RUN AND THE LST FIELD REPRESENTRS THE COMMAND 

      first field = minutes (m)
      2nd field = hours (h)
      3rd field = day of month (dom)
      4th field =month (mon)
      5th field =day of week (dow)
      6th field = command  

the crontjobs can be scheduled to run anytime of the day 


if for a specific you use an * it means always or any value for the field. an * in the day or week field means everyday or everyweek. the minimu 
time used by cron is thr MINUTE  you cant use seconds in cron


NOTE: HOURS USE 24 METHOD , DAY USE 0-7 0= SUNDAY  


                              PERFORMING CRON AT SPECIFIC TIMES 

For example you want to run cronjobs at specific times of the day or month , for example you want the cronjon to run at 5am ,7am , 6am 

you can write  * 5,7,6 * * * (command here is usally the path to script )


                                      SEPCIFYING A RANGE OF VALUES 

 to run a cronjob between a specific range of times do the following

 
you can write  * 5,7,6 * * * (command here is usally the path to the script )


so imagine you want the script to run at certain range of intervals that is from 9am to 5pm and between monday to friday , then the crontab can be written as 

 * * 9 -17 * * 1-5 (put the path to the command or script here)



                                                           USING THE SLASH OPERATOR 

You can use the slash operator to replace values that can be repeated over a certain interval    . for example you have */3 in day field it means the action 
will be performed every 3 days  or */2 for minutes means it will be repeated every 2 minutes 

                                    10  4,21 */3 * * pathtothefile

                                                                       SEVERAL CRON MARKERS 
There are several cron makers used to specify the most frequently used values;

@yearly (pathtothescript) = this will run yearly, on the 1st of january midnight once a year 
@monthly (pathtothescript) = this will run monthly, on the 1st of each month 
@weekly= once a week at midnight on sunday 
@daily = once a day at midnight 
@hourly = runs the task once an hour at the beginning of the hour 
@reboot = runs the specified task at boot time 


                                                              TO CHECK WHETHER THE CRON IS WORKING 

      To see the ouput of the crom command you can run the tail -f and the path to the file 

      on ubuntu ,you can see cronjobs on /var/log/syslog 
      on centos, you can see cronjobs on /var/log/cron

                                                 REMOVING THE CRONTAB FILE

                                                DENYING USERS TO RUN CRONTAB IN A SYSTEM
