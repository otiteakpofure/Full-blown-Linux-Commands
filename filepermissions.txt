                                    chmod u-w name of the file 

 to add multiple permissions together you can apend commands like this 

 chmod u-x,g+w,o-rwx (the name of the file )

 u = owner or user 
 g = group 
 o = others


                          TO CHANGE THE PERMISSION OF ALL PERSONS IN THE GROUP 

To change the persmission of all users in the group use the a command 
                                chmod  a+r , a-wx nameofthefile


        USING THE EQUALS = 

        To change the permission of files you can use the equals sign 

        chmod ug = rw , o =  user.txt ( using o and appending = without doing anything means that no permisson is attached to the file
        as related to the owner . it is similar to ---)
