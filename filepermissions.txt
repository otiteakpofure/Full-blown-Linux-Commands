 each file or directory has an owner and a group . by default, the owner is the user who creates a file and the group is the primary group 

 NOTE : IT IS NOT MANDATORY FOR A FILE OWNER TO BE IN THE SAME GROUP OWNER AS THE FILE 

                          OWNERSHIP OF A FILE/DIRECTORY 
The ownership of a file is determine by who created the file  can be changed using thre chown or chgrp or chmod 

NOTE: EVEN ALL PERMISSION ARE REMOVED FROM A FILE , THE ROOT CAN STILL MAKE MODIFICATIONS 


file permission is used either symbolic or octal permissions


NOTE: In file permissions any permissions can apply  only root or file owner can change permissions 



OPERATIONS FLAGS USED IN FILE PERSMISSIONS

The operation flag determine whether the permissions are to be removed , added or set 

- : a hypehn means remove 
+ : add persmioms
=: equal means change the current permissions to the specified permission 

for example , you create a file called games.txt and you want to remove the write permission of the User owner 

                                    chmod u-w name of the file 

 to add multiple permissions together you can apend commands like this 

 chmod u-x,g+w,o-rwx (the name of the file )

 u = owner or user 
 g = group 
 o = others


                          TO CHANGE THE PERMISSION OF ALL PERSONS IN THE GROUP 

To change the persmission of all users in the group use the a command 
                                chmod  a+r , a-wx nameofthefile


        USING THE EQUALS = 

        To change the permission of files you can use the equals sign 

        chmod ug = rw , o =  user.txt ( using o and appending = without doing anything means that no permisson is attached to the file
        as related to the owner . it is similar to ---)

        NOTE: In linux , a file does not have the same permissions as a directory 


         GIVING PERMISSIONS TO DIRECTORIES AND FILES AT ONE 

         FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE  directory name k1 which has various files such k2,k3,k4 

         to give permissions to all files withim this directory 
         navigate to the directory name and run the command 

            chmod -R (write permissions here) (write only directory here )


                                     REFERENCING OR CREATING PERMISSION OF ONE FILE TO LINK TO ANOTHER FILE 
for example , if you want to create permissions of one file to link to another file , do the following 

if we had to files 1.txt and 2.txt to allow the permissions of 1.txt to be matched with 2.txt , do the following 

if we wanted to 2.txt to reference 1.txt , do the following

  chmod --reference = (the reference file )  (the normal file)

   chmod --reference = 1.txt 2.txt 



                                        THE EFFECT OF PERSMISSIONS ON DIRECTORIES
 The write permission has solely effect on the execute permission . Permissions have different ecffe on both 
 note: The permission of the parent direcory is far more important than the permission of its sub directories 



                                                  USING FIND AND CHMOD COMMANDS
if you have various directories and you want to set the permissions of these files without affecting the directory

for example , you have a direcory that is called k1 and has files 1.txt and 2.txt , and you want to set these permissions
on the directories and not the files . 

~ = users home directory

to change the permissions on the files in the direcroty involves you combining find and chmod
