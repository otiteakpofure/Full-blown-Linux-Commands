Any domain name should be hosted on a authoritaitve nameserver , and the final holder for the information for that domain 

                            TO FIND AUTHORITATIVE nameserver

dig -t ns andthenameofthedomanin for example, you want to check google.com 

run the command 

                                 dig -t ns google.com 

NOTE: These shows the authoritatieve nameservers 

                                and if you want to see the authoritative nameservers, IP addresses 

imagine google.com has the nameserver ip addresses , ni.google.com

                                 dig -t a andthenameserver name

                                 so to find the ip address of that name server then run 

                                 dig -t a ni.google.com


                                      CONFIGURING THE NAMESERVER TO BE AUTHORITATIVE 
1.LOAD THE BIND9 SERVER TO CHECK IF IT WORKING USING SYSTEMCTL 
note: after loading the dns server , ensure that the zones files are loaded as this master server already loads the dns server which holds the zone files 
which contains important information about the zones which is called dns records and 
                                      
                            ADDING A NEW DOMAINS IN WHICH THE SERVER WILL BE AUTHORITATIVE 
TO ADD A NEW DOMAINS IN WHICH THE SERVER WILL BE AUTHORITATIVE USE THE vim /etc/bind.named.conf.local

                BY PUTTING TYPE MASTER IN THIS FILE mkes it the primary zone file and using the zone forms a new zone

2. create the zone file

                                               DNS records
SOA = start of authority records                
NS = NAME SERVER RECORD 
IN = INTETNET
@ = BASED DOMAIN WHICH @ = GOOGLE.COM FOR EXAMPLE THIS GOOGLE.COM CAN BE ANNY DOMAIN NAME 


THE LOCAL SERIAL 1 HELPS TO TELL OTHER NAMESERVER THAT CONTENTS OF OTHER NAMESERBERS ARE UPDATEED
