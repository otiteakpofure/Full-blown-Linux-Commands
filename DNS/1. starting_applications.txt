for example you install wireshark  you can run wireshark using sudo wirshark command which starts the application 


                            to get an ip address of a domain name

                             DNS SERVER 

It is wise to have 2 dns server and this is the primary master server and secodary server also known as the slave server.  

                              DNS PROPAGATION

IT IS PERIOD OF TIME WHEN YOU MAKE CHANGES TO A DOMAIN AND ALLOW THE CHANGES TO TAKE PLACE. it is also a tim in which ISP NODES ACROSS 

TAKE TO UPLOAD THIEIR CACHES ABOUT THE NEW DNS SERVER JUST CREATED 

                       TO CHECK IF THE AUTHORITATIVE DNS SERVERS WERE UPDATED 
After the dns propagation has taken place , to chcec if the dns was uodated run this command 

                dig -t ns (andthedomainame)
 this will display the authoritaitve name servers for the domain 

                           asking for dns server 

you can still ask dns servers for domain names using varioius names servers, for example to ask the localdns server in the local network 

use dig -t a @localhost (then the domain)

-t a = type address 

NOTE: IF YOU WANT TO ASK ANOTHER DNS SERVER FOR AN IPADDRESS 




                                      CONFIGURING THE SERVER 

INTERATIVE DNS QUERY: It is the query in which the dns server will you to check other server by offering other servers whicb may have the answer for your seacrch query 
RECURSIVE QUERY: It is th   the query in which the dns server will check for your resources by querying other server and then hand you want you are looking for 

                                             DNS FORWARDER



when a dns server receives a query it attempts to resolve the query  using zoes hosted locally or by using its cache,  if it can not be find locally 
 

A dns server configured to use a forwarder behaves as follows:

1. whn the DNS server recives a query it , attempts to resolve this query 
2. if th query cannot be resolved using local data , the DNS server forwards the query recursively to the DNS server that is designated as a forwarder 
3. if the forwarder is not unavailable, the DNS server attempts to resolved the query by itself , using iterative queries 


NOTE: what a dns forwarder is if the dns server you set cannot to the work another capable dns sever will do it 

for example , you have a dns server called AI if that dns server cannot do the work , you can set google as the dns server which helps forwarder upur request 


                                             TO SET THE DNS forwarder


To set the dns forwarder, open the vim /etc/bind/named.conf/options

  then under forwarders apply the various dns servers such as 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.8.4
