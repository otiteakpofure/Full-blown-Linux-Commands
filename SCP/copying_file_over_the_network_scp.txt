scp  = secure copy 

allows you copy files and directories over ssh connection 

                                                      COPYING A FILE FROM A CLIENT TO A SERVER 
1. To transfer from a client to a server you need to do the following: 

      scp -P ( state the port number for ssh) thenameofthefile username@ipaddress:THEDIRECTORYOF WHICH THE FILE SHOULD BE COPIED 

      for example you want to copy a file called man.txt on port 22

            scp -P 22 man.txt student@ipaddress:THDDIRECTORYPATH IN THIS CASE IS THE HOME DIRECTORY (~)

NOTE: PLEASE PORT 22 IS NOT NECESSARY TO SPECIFY  


                               TO GIVE THE FILE A NEW FILENAME WHILE SENDING IT TO THE DESTINATION
To give the file a new filename while sending it to the destination, use the command 
                                              scp -P ( state the port number for ssh) thenameofthefile username@ipaddress:THEDIRECTORYOF WHICH THE FILE SHOULD BE COPIED/newnameofthefile


                                                       COPYING A DIRECTORY
  In copying directorues , the use of r option is mandatory 

   scp -r -P ( state the port number for ssh) thenameofthedirectory username@ipaddress:THEDIRECTORYOF WHICH THE FILE SHOULD BE COPIED/newnameofthefile

                                       TO PRESERVE THE MODIFICATION AND ACCESS TIME 
 scp -P  -p( state the port number for ssh) thenameofthefile username@ipaddress:THEDIRECTORYOF WHICH THE FILE SHOULD BE COPIED/newnameofthefile

NOTE: To copy file please not the user who runs the command must have the read permission , and the destination users must have the write permissions

NOTE: Be careful when copying files between users which have the same name, SCP can copy the files wihtout warning 

                                                    COPYING A FILE FROM A REMOTE LOCATION TO A LOCAL LOCATION (server to client)
REMOTE LOCATION = SOURCE 
LOCAL LOCATION = DESTINATION ----------------------------------------------------------------

for examples lets say you want to copy a file from a  remote server to a desktop machine to the following 

 scp usernameofapersonontheserver@ipaddressoftheserver:directoryorfilepthtothefileyouwanttosendtotheremotedesktop  remotedesktoppath

                                            COPYING FILES BETWEEN TWO REMOTE SYSTEMS (TWO SERVERS)
TO DO THIS YOU MUSRT HAVE ACCESS TO BOTH MACHINES

SCP USERNAMEOFTHESOURCEUSER@IPADDRESOFTHESOURCEMACHINE:PATHTOTHESOURCEFILE   USERNAMEOFTHEDESTINATIONMACHINE@IPADDRESSOFHTHEDESINTATIONMACHINE:PATHTOTHEFILEWHERETHEFILEWILLBESTORED

                                                                  SSH FTP
STFP IS MORE COMPLEX THAN SCP AND IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH FTP
