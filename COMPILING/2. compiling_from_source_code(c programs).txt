compiling software from source code 


COMPILING : is basically transforming the source code into human readable machine code 


TYpically servers need to be compiled and to do this the gnu compiler or gcc is a collection of compilers of c languages.

the default ubuntu repository contains a package is called build essentials which contains lots of libraries , compilers and languages that are 
used 

                                 TO COMPILE SOFTWARE
To install build essentials for software compilation the following command can be run;

                sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential

                               FOR COMPILING C SOFTWARE 
For compiling software and used for cprograms 
                          gcc --version  ( it is the C compiler)


                                C++ COMPILER 
G++ --version is the C++ compiler 


                                        make 
it is utility used to build a collection of source files 


  for centos 

there is a package group called development group that contains all the required componeents 

so to install it in centos 
dnf  groud install "development tools"

                               COMPILING A SINGLE SOURCE APPLICATIONS

compiling a simple c program . imagine its a program that prints simple hello 

  gcc thesourcefilewhichcontainsthecode -o binary(thebinaryistheoutputofthecompliation)
                                        gcc hello.c -o hello


to execute an executable use the ./ command
