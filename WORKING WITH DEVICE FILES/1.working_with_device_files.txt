                     DD 
It is a system command line utility used to copy files 

why it is is different from the cp command which is used for only files and directroies , the dd command can be used to copy files 
from special direcctories in which the cp command cannot do 


NOTE: Please note , remember hardisk in  linux are represented as special device files 
on some linux these special files can be called sda5

dd can work diretory can also backup  the boosector of an hardrive , cloning a disk partition to another one , cloning a bootable usb disk 

NPTE: DD has dirve erasion capcabilities so backup of data is important 

                                            COMMAND SYNTAX FOR DD
CLONING ONE PARTITION TO THE OTHER  (copying from an external hardiver to your system)
dd if = thenameoftheexternalharddrive derived from mouting   of=pathtothefilewheretheclonewillbekept status=progress

if = input file 
of= output file 

it clones both empty and used files. if you have a usb devce of 10gb and only 1gb is used and 9gb is free the dd command will copy 
both used and filled space 


                                  COPYFING FROM YOUR SYSTEMTO YOUR EXTERNAL HARDRIVE 
dd if = Pathtothefilewheretheclonewillbekept   of=thenameoftheexternalharddrive derived from mouting status=progress

                               USING SYNC 

The use of sync in dd allows synchron FOR BOTH INPUT FILES AND OUTPUT FILES 

dd if = Pathtothefilewheretheclonewillbekept   of=thenameoftheexternalharddrive derived from mouting status=progress CONV = SYNC


            CLONING A PARTIONG TO ANOTHER ONE
NOTE: If you are cloning one partition to another, you should note that the destination partition should be same size as the source partition

for example, you have a hardrive of 70gb and you want to clone a partition of it which is   or you want to clone a partition of your system into 
a flash drive 

 dd if=thenameofthepartitionyouwanttoclone of=thenameoftheparitionthattheclonewillbesentto  status=progress


                              BACKUP AND RESTORE THE MBR (MASTER BOOT RECORD)
master boot record is a spcial kind of disk sector at the very beginning of the disk. it holds the information on how the logically partiton containing file system
are organized on that medium and contains executable code and it is usually referred to as the the bootloader

it represents the first sector of the disk with the size of 512 bytes

                                       SPECIFIYING THE BLOCK SIZE USING BS COMMAND 

You can specify the block size by using the command 

dd if=thenameofthedisk  of=thenameofthemasterbootrecord (/root/mbr.dat) bs=512 count=1

                                          CREATING A BOOTABLE DISK SUCH AS FLASH USING DD

NOTE: Creating a usb drive simply means it involves creating an operating system from the usb drive

To create a bootable disk such a flash using dd

1. find the name of the device file  using lsblk
2.  to make the usb drive bootable , it must be formatted by file system  a. first unmoountthedisk  b.format the disk using  mkvas and the file system such as vfat or ext4 
                                                     mkvas . vfat   
NOTE: MKFAS shows an output of various file types such as vfat , ntfs , minix ,ext4, ext2 ,ext3 etc 

                                             mkvas . thefilesystem  thenameoftheusbdrive 
3.  to make the usb drive bootable, that means creating an operating system from the usb drive , run the command below 

                               dd if=thepahtothedownloadedoperatingsystem of=thepathtotheusbdrive bs=sizeoftheblockstorage status=progress

                        





TO SEE A NAME OF A PARTITION :
Run fdisk -l 

NOTE: when this command is run check for properties such as device model and then you will know that
