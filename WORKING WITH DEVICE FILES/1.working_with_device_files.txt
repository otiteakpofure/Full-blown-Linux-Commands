                     DD 
It is a system command line utility used to copy files 

why it is is different from the cp command which is used for only files and directroies , the dd command can be used to copy files 
from special direcctories in which the cp command cannot do 


NOTE: Please note , remember hardisk in  linux are represented as special device files 
on some linux these special files can be called sda5

dd can work diretory can also backup  the boosector of an hardrive , cloning a disk partition to another one , cloning a bootable usb disk 

NPTE: DD has dirve erasion capcabilities so backup of data is important 

                                            COMMAND SYNTAX FOR DD
CLONING ONE PARTITION TO THE OTHER  (copying from an external hardiver to your system)
dd if = thenameoftheexternalharddrive derived from mouting   of=pathtothefilewheretheclonewillbekept status=progress

if = input file 
of= output file 

it clones both empty and used files. if you have a usb devce of 10gb and only 1gb is used and 9gb is free the dd command will copy 
both used and filled space
