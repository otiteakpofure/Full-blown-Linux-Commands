hARDLINK 

An associations are between a file and file structure is an hardlink 
an hardlink is a file that linkes to another file 


  to create a hardlink run the ln command  =  ln (the name of the file you want to create an hardlink for) ( the new name of the file you want to create)

  in hardlink if a change is made to one file it also appears on the other file as well 

                                      deleting hardlink
    if you delete hardlinks it will keep decrementing 

    NOTE : You cannot creata a hardlink to a directory or a different partition 

                                                    USING HARDLINK 
The use of hardlink also allows easy referene to files and this allows all files to be easily accessed 

                                   FINDIN FILES IN A DIRECTORY WITH HARDLINKS GREATED THAN 1 
For example you want to check a directory name man with all the files which have a hardlink greater than 1 hardlink 
            find /man/ -type f -links +1
