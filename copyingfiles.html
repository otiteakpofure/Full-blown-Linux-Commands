                 copying a file 

for example you want to copy a content of a file to another file and please note if that file is not created the cp will create it 
 for example cp move.txt sing.txt  ( if sing.txt isnt created the cp will) 


                             TO SHOW HOW FILES ARE COPIED 
Add the -v command 
                   cp -v (and the name of the files )
                                ADDING PROMPT BEFORE COMPYING
For example you want to copy file a into file b and you want to show prompt before copying  add -i 

             cp -i (and the name of the files)   and it will ask if it wants to overwrite the existing file 

                                  COPYING BOTH DIRECROTY AND FILES TO A DESTINATION
For example you want to copy both files and directories to a destination directory and file 
                                cp -r the direcory and the new directory 

This will copy the directory and check if the directory has child directorues and folders and copy them into the 
new directory . if the new directory does not have files and folder in its directory it will both create and copy 
the directory and files. 


NOTE : to copy directory you must add the -r command 

                                               COPYING FILES AND ENSURING PRESERVATION OF THE GROUP A USER IS 
If you copy files between users of the same group the particular user copying the file becomes the root and therefore has administrative access to the files and as such
to avoid being administrative user and to allow preservation of rights , use this command 

cp -p (the name of the files you want to copy)  by using p noboyd becomes root and the files remain the same  whether you run sudo or not it remains 
the same which i am referring to the ownership 

                                                     MOVING AND RENAMING FILES 
The mv command move files and directories and as well rename files and directories 

PLEASE NOTE: if you want to move a file to   a  different location and it that location there is a file that 
has the same name , this file will overwrite the existing file
