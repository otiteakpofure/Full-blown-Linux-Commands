                 copying a file 

for example you want to copy a content of a file to another file and please note if that file is not created the cp will create it 
 for example cp move.txt sing.txt  ( if sing.txt isnt created the cp will) 


                             TO SHOW HOW FILES ARE COPIED 
Add the -v command 
                   cp -v (and the name of the files )
                                ADDING PROMPT BEFORE COMPYING
For example you want to copy file a into file b and you want to show prompt before copying  add -i 

             cp -i (and the name of the files)   and it will ask if it wants to overwrite the existing file 

                                  COPYING BOTH DIRECROTY AND FILES TO A DESTINATION
For example you want to copy both files and directories to a destination directory and file 
                                cp -r the direcory and the new directory 

This will copy the directory and check if the directory has child directorues and folders and copy them into the 
new directory . if the new directory does not have files and folder in its directory it will both create and copy 
the directory and files. 


NOTE : to copy directory you must add the -r command 

                                               COPYING FILES AND ENSURING PRESERVATION OF THE GROUP A USER IS 
If you copy files between users of the same group the particular user copying the file becomes the root and therefore has administrative access to the files and as such
to avoid being administrative user and to allow preservation of rights , use this command 

cp -p (the name of the files you want to copy)  by using p noboyd becomes root and the files remain the same  whether you run sudo or not it remains 
the same which i am referring to the ownership 

                                                     MOVING AND RENAMING FILES 
The mv command move files and directories and as well rename files and directories 

PLEASE NOTE: if you want to move a file to   a  different location and it that location there is a file that 
has the same name , this file will overwrite the existing file

 note : dont forget to use -i for prompting 

 NOTE : to prevent overwriting of existing files when moving files 

  add the -n command 
  for example there are two files in various location with the same name lets say one.txt and one.txt 
  if you want to moves these files without overwriting the existing ones use the -n command 
     mv -n one.txt ones.txt

                                      MOVING AND UPDATING A FILE 
 If you want to move a file with the same name to two different locations but the files only after a particular file has been  modified
 
                                            use the - u command 
 have the same name -u command is used.  The -u command only works when the file is updated and therefore it will move 
                                        mv -u one.txt ones.txt

                                      RENAME A FILE WITH mv (FOR THE SAME DIRECTORY)

For example you have a file called a.txt if you want to rename it  


 you use mv a.txt abc.txt  it will rename a.txt to abc.txt

   NOTE: This works only if the source file is in the same loction as the destination file


                            MOVING A FILE FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTORIES AND RENAMING IT AT THE SAME TIME  (FOR DIFFERENT DIRECTORY)

                            you can move a file and rename a file at the same time 

                            for example a.txt will be rename while moving 

                            mv /dir/dir2/a.txt /dir/dir3/abc/txt 
a will change to abc.txt while moving 

                                                    USING THE RM COMMAND 
rm both files and directories 

NOTE: please not files rm using command line may never be RECOVERY

               To remove a direcory you must use -r command 
                rm -r (and name of directory )

                                     FORCEFULLY REMOVING  MULTIPLE FILES 
if you want remove files without recieving prompts use
                                 rm -rf (a.txt)

RM does not actually deletes a file but it just unlinks it and it can be recovered  using 

                                   SHRED 
To recover details of a removed file or overwrite its content before removing use the shred command 
                              use shred -vu -n 100 (name of the file)
 u = updates a file before 100 times before deleting it
