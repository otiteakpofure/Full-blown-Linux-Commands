                 copying a file 

for example you want to copy a content of a file to another file and please note if that file is not created the cp will create it 
 for example cp move.txt sing.txt  ( if sing.txt isnt created the cp will) 


                             TO SHOW HOW FILES ARE COPIED 
Add the -v command 
                   cp -v (and the name of the files )
                                ADDING PROMPT BEFORE COMPYING
For example you want to copy file a into file b and you want to show prompt before copying  add -i 

             cp -i (and the name of the files)   and it will ask if it wants to overwrite the existing file
