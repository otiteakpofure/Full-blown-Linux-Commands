 tar can compress both files and directories 

to compress use the tar command to create compress archived files

CREATING ARCHIVE = TAR -C 
EXTRACT ARCHI=TAR -X 
DISPLAY THE CONTENT OF THE ARCHIVE = TAR -T 
compresse thea rchive using gzip or tgze = tar -z 
to specify the name of the archive = tar -f 

for example you want to compresse a file in the directory 

tar -cvzf (the archive direcory you want to create which MUST be .tar.gz to end it lets the name of the file is man = man.tar.gz) and the 
path to the directiry which you want to archive 

NOTE: PLease ensure you -f before the file you wanrt to create which ends in tar.gz
  

                                              using bzip 
                    instead of using z option uise the j option 
tar -cjzf (the archive direcory you want to create which MUST be .tar.bz2 to end it lets the name of the file is man = man.tar.gz) and the 
path to the directiry which you want to archive 

NOTE : YOU CAN COMPRESS MORE THAN ONE FILES INTO IT 

                            EXCLUDE SOMEFILES FROM ARCHIVING 
FOR EXAMPLE YOU WANT EXCLUDE THE LIST OF MP4 IN A DIRECORY  USE 
                    tar --exclude = "*.mkv" 
                    PLEASE NOTE IF YOU WANT EXCLUDE VARIOUS FILES YOU MUST STATE THE EXCLUDE COMMAND FOR EACH OF THEM 
                    FOR EXAMPLE 

                    tar --exclude = "*.mkv"  --exclude = "*.config"

                                       extract the contents from an archive 

                                       tar -cvzf  (the name of the archive)
