using wget helps to download files from http, https, ftp servers 

It can start downloads , resume downloads , limit bandwiths, mirror a website 

                                 USING WGET AND SAVING A FILE SIMULTANEOUSLY 
To download a file and save a file, do the following 

  crate the directory  and run the command:
   wget -P  thecreateddirectory  linktothewebssite

       TO LIMIT THE BANDWIDTH 

To limit the bandwith so that wget does not consume the entire bandwith and slow the network do the following 
                  wget --limit-rate =100k -P  thecreateddirectory  linktothewebssite

NOTE : The 100k represents 100k per second , use M for megabytes and G for gigabytes

                          RESUMIMG AN INTERRUPTED download
For example , when you are downloading a file and network interrupts the file the download will start from beginning but to ensure your download continues from where it stopped ,  you can continue its download by doing the following:

wget -c -P  thecreateddirectory  linktothewebssite



                              TO DOWNLOAD MULTIPLE FILES 
To download multiple files do the following:

                   create a file and store the links of all files theRE   

                   wget -i thepathtothefile

for a huge download , put the download in the background by adding the following command:
  wget -b -i thepathtothefile

                     
       for example you close the terminal and want the download to continue , the following should be done

      nohup  wget -i thepathtothefile

                                        CREATING AN OFFLINE COPY
