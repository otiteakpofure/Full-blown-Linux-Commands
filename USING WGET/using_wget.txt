using wget helps to download files from http, https, ftp servers 

It can start downloads , resume downloads , limit bandwiths, mirror a website 

                                 USING WGET AND SAVING A FILE SIMULTANEOUSLY 
To download a file and save a file, do the following 

  crate the directory  and run the command:
   wget -P  thecreateddirectory  linktothewebssite

       TO LIMIT THE BANDWIDTH 

To limit the bandwith so that wget does not consume the entire bandwith and slow the network do the following 
                  wget --limit-rate =100k -P  thecreateddirectory  linktothewebssite

NOTE : The 100k represents 100k per second , use M for megabytes and G for gigabytes
