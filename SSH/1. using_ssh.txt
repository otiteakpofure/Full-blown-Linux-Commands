The `ssh` command is used to connect to a remote computer securely over a network. The `-l` option in `ssh` is used to specify the username to use when connecting to the remote server. Here's the basic syntax:

```
ssh -l username hostname
```

Where:
- `-l username` specifies the username you want to use for the SSH connection.
- `hostname` is the address or hostname of the remote server you want to connect to.

For example, if you want to connect to a server with the username "user" and the hostname "example.com", you would use:

```
ssh -l user example.com
```

This command will prompt you to enter the password for the specified username on the remote server, assuming password authentication is enabled. Alternatively, you can use key-based authentication for a more secure and automated login process.
