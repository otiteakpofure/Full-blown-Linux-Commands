when you run nmap on a specific host , this involves checking if services are running 

to check if a service is running on a particular host , do the following: 
 nmap -p (state the port number) (ip address of the service)

 NOTE: if you get a reply and it is stated that the host seems down, then do the following 
 
 nmap -p (state the port number) (ip address of the service) -Pn
