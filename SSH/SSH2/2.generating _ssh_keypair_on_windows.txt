                               GENERATING SSH KEYS ON WINODWS 

we can generated ssh public key authentication  using an ssh clients that supports RSA uahtneitcation 
a publc and prvated key 
if we want to autnetivate to networking device like ciso we need an ios 
SSH SERVER that supports PKA

putty is an ssh client, putty does not generate the keypair 
putty key generator helps in generating this keypair 

the keypair choosesn should be RSA and minimum length should be 2048 bits srtonger keys 4096 
NOTE: WHEN GENERATING A KEY PAIR ENSURE YOU MOVE THE MOUSE SO AS TO INCREASE ITS RANDOMNESS 

DO  NOT FORGET TO PUT A PARRPHRASE
