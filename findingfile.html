the find files and directories you use  the FIND and LOCATE <command>
NOTE : locate is not installed in ubuntu by default so installe it sudo apt install mlocate 

                             LOCATE USE A DATABSE BUT IT SHOULD UPDATE EVERYDAY AND MANUAL 
                             by running this command sudo updatedb  which will searched by the locate command
                             
                             NOTE:IF YOU ARE SEARCHING FOR A FILE USING LOCATE EVEN IF IT HAS BEEN DELETED , LOCATE WILL STILL FIND IT SO  
                             TO AVOID SUCH PROBLEMS . DO the following 

                             for exmample woman.txt have been deleted to ensure locate doesnt find it again even if thre database has not
                             been updated the following should be done 

                             locate - e woman.txt

USING LOCATE 

For example you want to locate a directory with the password run the 

                  locate password 
it will produce a list of all directories with password 

BASE NAME : FROM THE ABOISLUTE PATH DOES THE EXACT NAME EXIST FOR EXAMPLE LOOKING FOR A FILE CALLED WOMAN 

          when you use locate -b  == if i has /usr/local/share/woman  = it will prevent files and folders having woman in it 

                                           to search the base name 
use locate -b 
   

                                    to seach for an exact file using the locate command use the command below  let say the file is man
locate -b "\man"

NOTE : This will check for both file and directory from the ABSOLUTE PATH 

                                  using the locate -i command 
to locate files using the -i command it ignore casesensensitive infomation , so if you type it it will still bring out the file
