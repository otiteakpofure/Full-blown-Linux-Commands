the find files and directories you use  the FIND and LOCATE <command>
NOTE : locate is not installed in ubuntu by default so installe it sudo apt install mlocate 

                             LOCATE USE A DATABSE BUT IT SHOULD UPDATE EVERYDAY AND MANUAL 
                             by running this command sudo updatedb  which will searched by the locate command
                             
                             NOTE:IF YOU ARE SEARCHING FOR A FILE USING LOCATE EVEN IF IT HAS BEEN DELETED , LOCATE WILL STILL FIND IT SO  
                             TO AVOID SUCH PROBLEMS . DO the following 

                             for exmample woman.txt have been deleted to ensure locate doesnt find it again even if thre database has not
                             been updated the following should be done 

                             locate - e woman.txt

USING LOCATE 

For example you want to locate a directory with the password run the 

                  locate password 
it will produce a list of all directories with password 

BASE NAME : FROM THE ABOISLUTE PATH DOES THE EXACT NAME EXIST FOR EXAMPLE LOOKING FOR A FILE CALLED WOMAN 

          when you use locate -b  == if i has /usr/local/share/woman  = it will prevent files and folders having woman in it 

                                           to search the base name 
use locate -b 
   

                                    to seach for an EXACT file using the locate command use the command below  let say the file is man
locate -b "\man"

NOTE : This will check for both file and directory from the ABSOLUTE PATH 

                                  using the locate -i command 
to locate files using the -i command it ignore casesensensitive infomation , so if you type it it will still bring out the file 

                                using locate -r command 
                        locate -r = regex expression so its searches for that exact stirng 




                          WHICH COMMAND 
This is used for finding the files of a linux command . for example you want to find the file path for rm 
  run which rm 

  it will print out the path to the command file 

  to seacrh for whether a command exist in more than one directory use the following command 

   which -a and the name of the command  


                                                       FIND 

Difference between find and locate is find does not use a database 

 to find a file using ( -iname)
  
                              find -iname and the name of the file 


find a file wihout its extension to find a file 
for example you want to find a file without its extension, 
find -iname todo* = it will find all todo files regardless of its extension  or using find -iname "todo*" or if you want to check for a particular
string in the file whether at the beginning or not do th following  find  . -name "*todo*"


                                        FIND AND DELETING THE FILE 
    FIND -name (place the name of the file) delete 

    it will find and delete the file 

                                running ls command on find
                            find -ls
