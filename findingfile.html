the find files and directories you use  the FIND and LOCATE <command>
NOTE : locate is not installed in ubuntu by default so installe it sudo apt install mlocate 

                             LOCATE USE A DATABSE BUT IT SHOULD UPDATE EVERYDAY AND MANUAL 
                             by running this command sudo updatedb  which will searched by the locate command
                             
                             NOTE:IF YOU ARE SEARCHING FOR A FILE USING LOCATE EVEN IF IT HAS BEEN DELETED , LOCATE WILL STILL FIND IT SO  
                             TO AVOID SUCH PROBLEMS . DO the following 

                             for exmample woman.txt have been deleted to ensure locate doesnt find it again even if thre database has not
                             been updated the following should be done 

                             locate - e woman.txt

USING LOCATE 

For example you want to locate a directory with the password run the 

                  locate password 
it will produce a list of all directories with password 

BASE NAME : FROM THE ABOISLUTE PATH DOES THE EXACT NAME EXIST FOR EXAMPLE LOOKING FOR A FILE CALLED WOMAN 

          when you use locate -b  == if i has /usr/local/share/woman  = it will prevent files and folders having woman in it 

                                           to search the base name 
use locate -b 
   

                                    to seach for an EXACT file using the locate command use the command below  let say the file is man
locate -b "\man"

NOTE : This will check for both file and directory from the ABSOLUTE PATH 

                                  using the locate -i command 
to locate files using the -i command it ignore casesensensitive infomation , so if you type it it will still bring out the file 

                                using locate -r command 
                        locate -r = regex expression so its searches for that exact stirng 




                          WHICH COMMAND 
This is used for finding the files of a linux command . for example you want to find the file path for rm 
  run which rm 

  it will print out the path to the command file 

  to seacrh for whether a command exist in more than one directory use the following command 

   which -a and the name of the command  


                                                       FIND 

Difference between find and locate is find does not use a database 

 to find a file using ( -iname)
  
                              find -iname and the name of the file 


find a file wihout its extension to find a file 
for example you want to find a file without its extension, 
find -iname todo* = it will find all todo files regardless of its extension  or using find -iname "todo*" or if you want to check for a particular
string in the file whether at the beginning or not do th following  find  . -name "*todo*"


                                        FIND AND DELETING THE FILE 
    FIND -name (place the name of the file) delete 

    it will find and delete the file 

                                running ls command on find
                            find -ls 

                                                             
                                  FIND DIRECTORIES BY TYPE
find -name (place the name of the directory here )  type d 

PLEASE NOTE: This command is just search for directories 

SEARCHING FOR DIRECTORIES INSIDE DIRECTORIES 
For example you want to search for directories inside directories
 you can run  

  find (the name of the directory) -type d -maxdepth 2 ( you can put any number if you want this will showcase how much deep you want to search)


SEARCHING FOR DIRECTORIES INSIDE DIRECTORIES  AND ADDING THEIR PERMISSIONS 
find (the name of the directory) -type d -maxdepth 2 -PERM 755 ( YOU can use any permissions here )

This will check for permissions on directories while searching two levles deep 


                                                      TO SEARCH BY SIZE 
        Find (the name of the directory) -type f -size (put the number of size) -ls 

          FURTHERMORE , to search for file based off its criteria in size can be done like 
          for example you want to seach for file which has let me say +10mb

          sudo find (place name of the directory) -type f -size (put the number of size you want inthis case its +10M) -ls 

          and as well it can be done for minus 



 SEARCHING FOR FILES IN DIRECTORIES BASED OF GIVEN SIZE RANGE 

 Lets say you want to search for files between +5M and less than +10M 

 sudo (name of the directory) -type f -size +5m -size -10m ( this will search for size between the range of the files )

                                    fINDING FILES BY TIMESTAMPS such as modification time, access time and change time 
for example you want to check by modification time 

 find (the name of the directory) -type f -mtime (0) = 0 means files modified within the last 24 hours 

                                                  1 = files modified between 1 and 2 days ago 
                                                  
find (the name of the directory) -type f -atime (0) = 0 means files modified within the last 24 hours 
                                                 +1 = means it will check files which are atleast accessed two days ago 

                                                 TO SEARCH BY MINUTE
                                                 find (the name of the directory) -type f -AMIN (-60)    = amin means access minute  
                                                 find (the name of the directory) -type f -MMIN (0)    = modification minute
                                                 find (the name of the directory) -type f -CMIN (0)    = change minute     

                                                 to seaceh for files changes within 60 minutes you use -60
                                    


                                                 TO SEACRH BY OWNER AND GROUP 
FOR EXAMPLE LETS say a groupd is called gdm 

to seacrh for files within that group use = find (the name of the directory) -type f -group  (place the group here (gdm is the group)) -ls
to searh for fles for a user  = find (the name of the directory) -type f -user (place name of user here) -ls

                                      to seacrh for a file which does not belong to a user or group do this

                                      find (the name of the directory) -type f -not -user (place name of user here) -ls



                                      FIND AND EXECUTE A COMMAND ON A FILE 
To search a file and execute a command on the file 
                                you can use -exec or -ok 

                                for example you want to display contents of a file 
sudo find /etc -type f -mtime 0 -exec cat {} \;
 this command will find files modified in the last 24 hours and execute their contents using cat
