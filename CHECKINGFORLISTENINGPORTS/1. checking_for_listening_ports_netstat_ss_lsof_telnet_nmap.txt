when troubleshooting network connectivity issues , is to check if the server is listening on a specific port

                                               TO DISPLAY ALL OPEN PORTS 
this is used to check services and which port they are listening on 
To display all open ports, 
 netstat -tupan

 t = tcp ports
 u = udp ports
 p= process ID and the name of the programme which is listening 
 a= all ports both listening and not listening 
 n= numerical addresses instead of trying to determine  SYMBOLIC HOST AND POST NAMES

NOTE:in the local address column if you see somthijg like 0:0.0.0 of an ip address it means that the process is listening in all ip address of the host 



                       CHECKING IF A SPECIFIC PORT IS LISTENING 
To chek if a specific port is listening for example port 22 you can do the following 

                          netstat -tupan | grep :22

NOTE: IF an ouput shows under this command it means that the port is opened , but if an ouput does not show under this command
it means the port is closed 

NGINX is a well known web server 

                                                         USING THE SS COMMAND 
This is a new command and might replace netstat in the future  ; ss = socket statistics and shows informagtion similar to netstat
. it shows more tcp and udp information and its faster than netstat

                                                    TO GET ALL LISTENING PORTS 
        ss -tupan 

                                                        LSOF = LIST OPEN FILES
 This gets a list of open files  run the LSOF command

                                CHECK ALL THE FILES OPEN BY THE PROECESSES OF A SPECIFIC USER
    
to get all the list of files open by a specific user run the lsof -u username. for example, the username is jake 

                                            lsof -u jake

                                            CHEKING ALL FILES OPEN BY ANYONE EXCEPT A SPECIFIC USER
To check all files open by others users apart from a specifi user . for example , you want to check all files open by other users except the one 
jake has  open 

                                           lsof -u ^ username  = so to check this , run the lsof -u ^ jake 


                                             TO LIST ALL FILES OPEN BY A SPECIFIC process

                    TO LIST ALL FILES OPEN BY A SPECIFIC PROCESS such as when you start a service  for example  NGINX

                    you can run  the command =  lsof -c nginx 

                                               TO CHECK THE files which the open ports have made available 
This command checks which files various ports have opened in the system   for example lets check all the tcps files that have been open 

                                                lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN

This shows files that open tcp ports which are in the listen state, 

                                                  

                                                TO CHECK THE files which the open ports have made available WITH HOSTNAMES AND PORTS 

This displays port and hostsnames in numeric format 


                                             lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -nP

                                TO CHECK AN OPEN PORT AND UNDERSTAND WHICH FILE HAS OPENED IT 

This command checks which particular file  has openeed a port 

                                               lsof -iTCP:22 -sTCP:LISTEN -nP



NOTE: NETSTAT, SS AND lSOF can be used to display open ports on the current system.  this checks ports running on your own  system 



                       SCANNING PORTS ON SYSTEM WHICH IS NOT YOURS 
YOU CAN USE THE TELNET COMMAND OR NMAP  TO SCAN PORTS ON AN ANOTHER SYSTEM 


                                  TELNET

Scanning ports in another Ip address 
                  for example you want to scan port 22 in another SYSTEM

                  telnet (ipaddress) portnumber 

   NMAP 
which is a professional port scanner , to use nmap 

nmap (ipaddress)

  to scan a specific port using nmap 

nmap (ipaddress) portnumber 

to scan the portnumnber version 

nmap (ipaddress) portnumber  -sV
