when troubleshooting network connectivity issues , is to check if the server is listening on a specific port

                                               TO DISPLAY ALL OPEN PORTS 
this is used to check services and which port they are listening on 
To display all open ports, 
 netstat -tupan

 t = tcp ports
 u = udp ports
 p= process ID and the name of the programme which is listening 
 a= all ports both listening and not listening 
 n= numerical addresses instead of trying to determine  SYMBOLIC HOST AND POST NAMES

NOTE:in the local address column if you see somthijg like 0:0.0.0 of an ip address it means that the process is listening in all ip address of the host 



                       CHECKING IF A SPECIFIC PORT IS LISTENING 
To chek if a specific port is listening for example port 22 you can do the following 

                          netstat -tupan | grep :22

NOTE: IF an ouput shows under this command it means that the port is opened , but if an ouput does not show under this command
it means the port is closed
