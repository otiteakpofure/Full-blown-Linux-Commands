This includes securing the communication using OpenSSL and digital certificates.

in creating this for a server , do the following 
1. obtaining  a diigital ceritificate for the server  (comodo certificate authority)
2. using the OpenSSL certificate to encrypt connection through the digital certificate  (lets Encrypt)


1. first steop involves installing certbot which is a client for the CA by running the command  apt update && apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache
2. after doing this, this will alow the CA to provide the domain with a certificate  by running certbot-d (andthenameofthedomain)

NOTE: THIS SHULD BE THE PATH TO THE DOMAIN IN WHICH HOUSES THE VIRTUAL HOST 

3. CERTBOT runs twice a day and to check th e expiration/renewal date of certbot run the command below

                                                                      certbot renew --dry-run
