mysql will help to store and manage our database and  to install MySQL use the command 

apt update && apt install mysql-server 

NOTE: Once the installation is complete the sql server starts automatically, and also my sql is not secure , so it essential that a security script
      is run with mysql to ensuring all services are secured , this scripts is pre-installed with sql 
                  - this includes removing some sql accounts and setting the administrator password 

to do this run the command : mysql_secure_installation ( this shows the validate password component)
and this is used to test the strenght of sql users password ensure the stronggest level of the password is chosen 

and after set the password for root of the sql server which only has power associated with the root account of sql  

after this is done remove the anonymous users accoint which exists  and well restricting root access to the data machine and removing the test database as well 

if putting yes if you want to reload the privilege tables 

and to test the communication with the sql server : to test this , use the sql client which connects to the sql server 

 and to connect run the command  

                                              mysql -u (andthenameoftheusername)  NOTE: in this example, i used root as the name of the user 

NOTE:  This command allows you log into the sql server and then you can run all configurations
