GETting information about the system hardware gives information about the system hardware and what is inside the computer , there are many reasons 
to find out details about your hardware . either find out informatio about why some applictions does not work on your hardware, 

NOTE:In virtualized environment, the information displayed about the operating system is the operating system of the virual servers/os creatd in virtual environment 
and  not the main operating system 



                                    GETTING OVERVIEW OF THE SYSTEM HARDWARE 
                                    
To display an overview of the system hardware , run the following command                                                    
                                              LSHW

NOTE: this is a small tool that will show detailed information about the machine. it will show the port, the exact information, memory configuration, cpu version, main board configiuration, speed cache configuration 
       bus speed and manny more 

       to make it better use it with grep or send the output into a file 

if you need the output inanother format, you can use the following command  eith json or html as required by you

                                      lshw -json  ( and this will show the output in a different format)



                                            CHECKING ONLY SUMMARY OF THE HARDWARE information
TO  get only a summary of the hardware information and not comprehensive information

                                lshw -short 

                                                     GETTING INFORMATION ABOUT THE HARDWARE ELEMENT 
To get information about the hardware element;

                                 inxi -Fx 

NOTE: This command is  not avalaible on all linux distributions 


                                                          GETTING INFORMATION ABOUT CPU 

LSCPU = 

This gives information of the CPU 

                                                   TO GET THE INFORMATION OF THE CPU BUT IN ANOTHER format

To get the information about the cpu in another format , do the following 

                                            lshw -C cpu 

NOTE: THIS print informatio  about the cpu in another format


                                                     VIEWING CPU INFORMATION

TO view certain information   about the cpu , do the following . for example , you want to view information about the mhz of the cpu 

                                                      lscpu | grep -i mhz 

This will show information about the mhz of the cpu 

                                               TO VIEW THE CPU INFORMATION IN JSON format

To view the cpu information in JSON format , do the following . 

                                                   lscpu -J 



                                                 GETTING ALL POSSIBLE DETAILS ABOUT THE COMPUTER MEMORY 

To get all possible details about the computer memory and their capacity run the command 
NOTE: DMIDECODE list information about the ram memory instaled on the system 



                                 dmidecode -t memory (the memory word here shows informatio about the memory)

to see the memory size for example,  run the command 

                                         dmidecode -t memory | grep -i size

     for checking maybe like maximum memory that can be installed on a system , use this command 

                                         dmidecode -t memory | grep -i max   

                                     TO SEE THE AMOUNT OF MEMORY USED OF FREE 
    RUN free -m  = this will display the amount of free or used mormey or total memory

fdisk -l  and the name of the disk   for example fdisk -l /dev/sda     

NOTE: with the use of fdisk , you can change partitions, view crreate or remove partitions on a hardrive 

                             GETTING SATADRIVE PARAMETERS
                                                   HDPARM
To get information about the satadrive parameters,  run the command , can also be used to check the performance of hardsk

                                               hdparm -i /dev/sda   ( to get more details change the i to I )

checking disking information using timing sequence 

                                                 hdparm -t --direct (thenameofthehardive) =/dev/sda 

this can be used to check the pefromrnace between partitions on the hardisk 

t= check time of device performance 

                                to show informatio  about the wirless devices 

run iw-list command 
                                                     file system of deviess wirless, attached , fixed etc 

/etc/proc     

In this proc directory is where all information of devices, size and all aociated devices will be shown , version of the kernel


                                                DISPLAYING VERSION OF KERNEL 
To display the version of the running kernel run,

                                            uname -r    

to display a more detailed version run , uname -a 

                                                 COMMAND TO SHOW BATTERY 

for example , you can login into another system using ssh and want to check if the device uses battery or power source 

to do that run apt install acpi 

and to see the battery status run ,  acpi -bi
