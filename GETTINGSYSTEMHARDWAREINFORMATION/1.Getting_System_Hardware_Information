GETting information about the system hardware gives information about the system hardware and what is inside the computer , there are many reasons 
to find out details about your hardware . either find out informatio about why some applictions does not work on your hardware, 

NOTE:In virtualized environment, the information displayed about the operating system is the operating system of the virual servers/os creatd in virtual environment 
and  not the main operating system 



                                    GETTING OVERVIEW OF THE SYSTEM HARDWARE 
                                    
To display an overview of the system hardware , run the following command                                                    
                                              LSHW

NOTE: this is a small tool that will show detailed information about the machine. it will show the port, the exact information, memory configuration, cpu version, main board configiuration, speed cache configuration 
       bus speed and manny more 

       to make it better use it with grep or send the output into a file 

if you need the output inanother format, you can use the following command  eith json or html as required by you

                                      lshw -json  ( and this will show the output in a different format)



                                            CHECKING ONLY SUMMARY OF THE HARDWARE information
TO  get only a summary of the hardware information and not comprehensive information

                                lshw -short 

                                                     GETTING INFORMATION ABOUT THE HARDWARE ELEMENT 
To get information about the hardware element;

                                 inxi -Fx 

NOTE: This command is  not avalaible on all linux distributions 


                                                          GETTING INFORMATION ABOUT CPU 

LSCPU = 

This gives information of the CPU 

                                                   TO GET THE INFORMATION OF THE CPU BUT IN ANOTHER format

To get the information about the cpu in another format , do the following 

                                            lshw -C cpu 

NOTE: THIS print informatio  about the cpu in another format


                                                     VIEWING CPU INFORMATION

TO view certain informatio  about the cpu
