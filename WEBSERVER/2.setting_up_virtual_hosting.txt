                            virtual hosting 
if you want to host more than one domain on an apache webserver that has a single ip address , you use a virtual hosting


Apache serves document to the client from the DOCUMENT ROOT , which is found in /var/www/html/

NOTE: IF YOU HAVE A WEBSITE OR RATHER PREWRITTEN CODE , COPY IT TO THE ABOVE DIRECTORY AND APACHE WILL SERVER IT TO THE WEB BROWSER



NOTE: IF YOU WANT TO HOST MORE THAN ONE WEBSITE/ domain and they share the same IP address , you need to create document root for all the documents
and this is what it means having one website on a single serrver 


                                  TO CREATE MORE DOMAINS

you will need to create more root document for each domain names undert the /var/www/html/

and set the ownership of the document to the user in which the apache server runs  .please check the video for this  and as well change the file permission for the directory 

After that , changing the ownership and permissions of the document , you need to open the html file and make your changes as you like 

after the changes have been done , you need to configure apache to serve contents when a user visits the ports  and by doing this  create a directory 
on /etc/apache2 and locate the sites-available directory. 

and in this directory, open the sites available command to showcase the    configiration file to edit configurations, 
                in this configuration file 

                write the following 

                <VirtualHost *:80>
                ServerName: thenameofthedomain 
                ServerAlias:thenameofthedomain 
                DocumentRoot:the location to where the document root was created for the domain 

                The 3 above is compulsory 

                ServerAdmin: theemailaddressoftheadmin 
                Errolog:thepaht to the error logs which is found in the var/log 
                CustomLog:path to the error logs 
                
                </VirtualHost>

After this close and save the file and run the following command: 



after this file is saved , please note that the virtual host is not saved ane enable , and so to enable it, RUN THE COMMAND 

a2ensite andthenameofthevirtualhist file 

NOTE: THIS SHOULD BE DONE WITHOUT CONF EXTENSION AT THE END 

IN APACHE , THE FOLLOWING DIRECTORIES ARE IMPORTANT 

1/etc/apache2/ = will allow all sites from sites-enabled 


NOTE: WITH MORE WEBSITE , YOU CREATE A DIRECTORY UNDER THE 

/VAR/WWW = 

AND THEN you create a virtual host file in sites available 

and enable the site using a2ensite and then restart the webserver
