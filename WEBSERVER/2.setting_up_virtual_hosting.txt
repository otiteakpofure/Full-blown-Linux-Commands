                            virtual hosting 
if you want to host more than one domain on an apache webserver that has a single ip address , you use a virtual hosting

NOTE: IF YOU HAVE A WEBSITE OR RATHER PREWRITTEN CODE , COPY IT TO THE ABOVE DIRECTORY AND APACHE WILL SERVER IT TO THE WEB BROWSER



NOTE: IF YOU WANT TO HOST MORE THAN ONE WEBSITE/ domain and they share the same IP address , you need to create document root for all the documents
and this is what it means having one website on a single serrver
