USING THE ALIAS command
when you run certain command frequently you can create and alias for them and this will run the command faster 

for example for cat  man.txt , instead of opening over and over agin you can set an alias then run the alias command with it 

alias vps = "this input should b place there "  so instead of typing the whole word just run th alias name set up




                                                ALIAS COMMAND 

if you tired of writing long command and you want to shorrten the command you use an alias 

every linux distribution has a few alias placed 

                                              TO SEE THE LIST OF ALIAS
Run the alias command 

NOTE: An alias with the same name of a command for example you give ls = printme and then you write printme in the . the printme will superced the ls command everytime
