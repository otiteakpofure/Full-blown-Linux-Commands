USING THE ALIAS command
when you run certain command frequently you can create and alias for them and this will run the command faster 

for example for cat  man.txt , instead of opening over and over agin you can set an alias then run the alias command with it 

alias vps = "this input should b place there "  so instead of typing the whole word just run th alias name set up




                                                ALIAS COMMAND 

if you tired of writing long command and you want to shorrten the command you use an alias 

every linux distribution has a few alias placed 

                                              TO SEE THE LIST OF ALIAS
Run the alias command 

NOTE: An alias with the same name of a command for example you give ls = printme and then you write printme in the . the printme will superced the ls command everytime 
                                             
                                             TO CREATE AN ALIAS 

Run the following 

                              alias thenameyouwanttogivethecommand = "therealcommand" which is 
                              for example the command is  ls 
                              so it will now be 

                              alias c = "ls"

so anytime you type c it will replace the ls command 




NOTE: IF YOU OPEN A NEW TERMINAL THE ALIAS WILL NOT WORK , IT WORKS ONLY IN THE TERMINAL IT IS CREATED BUT IF UOU WANT TO DECLARE THEM 
      AND MAKE THEM PERSISTENT , YOU GO TO THE ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc



when you open this file , under the file you write your alias command and make it persistent 


                                            DATE AND TIME   

To print the date and time , run the command:

                                     date +%F\ %T  

                                              TO REMOVE AN ALIAS 
To remove an alias run the ;
                               unalias command alongside the command name yu want to remove
