Interplanetary file system (IPFS ) is a protocol designed to create a permanent and decentrlized methods of storing and sharing files 

IPFS aims to replace http and build a better web 


IPFS properties 
IPFS is a peer-to-peer decentralized and distibuted file system 
IPFS is a  CDN 
IPFS is also fault-tolerant with zero downtime 
IPFS is censhorship-resistant  - IT IS LIKE A PERMIANANT WEB ONCE IT IS ON ITS ON ITS NETWORK IT IS SAVED 
IPFS uses cinten address not location address like http 

it is based on bitorent  and git and used for delivery static images ,videos, documents saving and delivering 


a machigne that runs ipfs software is an ipfs node , it is a peer-to-peer decentralized and distibuted file system which has directory and files that can be moiunted 

NOTE: IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO REMOVE A FILE IN IPFS , EVEN IF THE ORIGINATOR DELETES IT OTHERS WILL STILL HAVE A COPY OF IT  


                                               CONTENT ADDRESSING VS LOCATION ADDRESSING 

LOCATION ADDRESSING:   contents is assesssed by loication 
                        whoever contros the locatio contrils the content 

CONTENT ADDRESSING: FILE ARENT ANYMORE BASED ON "WHERE THEY ARE" but based on "what they are "
                    there is no location of the files, no one controls the files:

                    to see contents regardless of the location they are stored on IPFS referes to those contents by # which signifies the contents itself 

      it works by taking a file and hashing it cryptographically . it works by taking a file and hashing it cryptographically and then with the file has a unique hash 
      and the hash is the address of the file               

pinning is a mechamism that allows you to tell IPFS to always keep a given object and never remove it 

                                            ADDING A FILE TO THE IPFS NETWORK 
sudo ipfs add thenameofthefile

NOTE: AN HASH IS GEENRATED 

                                AND TO ACCESS THE FILE, THE HASH IS GENERATED 

note: what happens after a file is generated is that the file is chunked into bloacks and save locally in a folder and would be only avaialbnle if other blocks if the ipfs gateway is opened 

after the file is requested , it will be saved in the gateway hash , ipfs allows data to be retrieved locally even when the network is downby local access 
i mean that documents can be accessed even if the network is down 

the main ipfs gateway is ipfs.io/ipfs/ thehashofthefile 

http and https : are loction based
