ipfs files exist as someones keeps it , and it uses an aggressive caching , files are only lost when they are not peers that stores the files


TO PREVENT COLECTION RUBBISH FILES AND TI ENSYRE THAT ONLY PROPER FILES ARE COLLECTED AND KEPT , YOU PIN THE HASH OF THE FILE 

NOTE: OBJECTS ADDRED WITH IPFS ADD ARE PINNED BY DEFAULT 

 THERE IS A MECHANISM THAT TELLS IPFS TO KEEP A FILE AND NEVER REMOVE IT FROM THR IPFS NETWORK 

 TO ADD A FILE RUN , IPFS ADD THENAMEOFTHEFILE 

                                     LISTING ALL OBJECTS PINNED TO LOCAL STORAGE 
To list all objects pinned to local storage, 

                            ipfs pin ls --type=all 

        once a file is pinned it wont br remove by the garbage collector 

                                             UNPINNING A FILE
SUDO IPFS PIN RM ANDTHEHASHOFTHEFILE 


TO CJECK IF THE FULES NO LONGER EXIST AFTER UNPINNING IT 

RUN  SUDO IPFS REPO GC -garbage collector

THEN AFTER RUN IPFS CAT HASHOFTHEFILE 

                                            NOTE: LOCAL PINNING MAYBE NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT FILES ARE ALWAYS KEPT 

                TO ENSURE IMPORTANT DATA IS KEPT AND NOT REMOVED BY THE garbage  collector  you can use pinning services 


                PINNING SERVICES INCLDE
